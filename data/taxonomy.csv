4,Make Pastel De Papa,4,none,5,Grease a nine-by-nine-inch (23cm x 23cm) oven dish.,"Good trick: If you have the paper from a stick of butter, don't throw it out. Rub the buttery side along the dish to grease it. Waste not, want not!"
5,Make Pastel De Papa,5,none,6,Spread a layer of mashed potatoes along the bottom and sides of the dish.,Use a little more than half of the mashed potatoes. Make the layer about a half an inch (1.3cm) thick (but less so on the sides). Sprinkle with half the shredded cheese.
6,Make Pastel De Papa,6,none,7,Spread a layer of ground beef.,Gently press it down with a spatula to compact it. Add a layer of hard boiled egg.

9,Make Pastel De Papa,9,none,10,Top with the remaining cheese and some paprika.,
10,Make Pastel De Papa,10,none,11,Bake in a preheated oven at 350ºF/180ºC until the top is just starting to turn golden brown (approximately 15-30 minutes).,
11,Make Pastel De Papa,11,none,12,Remove from the oven and let the dish stand for 10 minutes at room temperature.,Use a spatula to divide and serve.
12,Make Pastel De Papa,12,none,13,Finished.,
13,Make Chiles Rellenos,0,none,1,Make the filling.,"You will make two fillings: one comprised of meat, and the other of cheese.          Meat filling - Fry the ground beef in a standard non-stick pan. Chop up the tomato and one of the onions. Add the chopped ingredients to the pan when the meat is fully brown. Remove the pan from the heat and give the ingredients a stir. Cheese filling - Grate the cheddar cheese into a bowl with a cheese grater. When the whole pound is grated, chop up and add the remaining onion.;"
14,Make Chiles Rellenos,1,none,2,Roast the chile peppers.,"Sometimes, you can buy the peppers already roasted, especially in areas where chiles are a popular part of local cuisine. You can also buy them online, roasted and frozen.          To roast the chile peppers yourself, put them on the grill or on a gas stove and leave them over the open flame, rotating until they are completely charred. Then rinse them off in cold water, rubbing off the burnt skin. You should now have 20 tender chiles ready to be stuffed."
15,Make Chiles Rellenos,2,none,3,Prepare the batter.,"This can be done while the chiles are roasting. Place a dozen egg whites in a bowl. Using an egg beater, beat the whites until they firm up. When they are firm and white, almost like whipped cream, stir in the egg yolks."
16,Make Chiles Rellenos,3,none,4,Cut an opening in the side of the chile.,"Make it large enough that stuffing can be put in, but not so large that the chile pepper will fall apart. At this point, you can carefully scrape out the seeds with a butter knife to reduce the heat of the pepper, but this is optional."
17,Make Chiles Rellenos,4,none,5,Stuff the chiles.,"Be careful because the soft, roasted chiles are easily torn. Begin with the meat stuffing. Portion out some of the stuffing and fill the chile. When 10 of the chiles are filled, do the same to the remaining chiles with the cheese stuffing. Don't stuff them so much that the slit can't be closed."
18,Make Chiles Rellenos,5,none,6,Pin the chiles with the toothpicks.,It doesn't need to be perfect; it's just to keep any stuffing from falling out while you fry them.
19,Make Chiles Rellenos,6,none,7,Prepare a pan with vegetable oil.,Allow the oil to get hot but keep setting on low.
20,Make Chiles Rellenos,7,none,8,Coat the chiles with the flour.,Coat the the chile peppers with flour to reduce the water content and to create a dry surface for the egg white batter to adhere to.
21,Make Chiles Rellenos,8,none,9,Dip the stuffed chiles in the egg batter.,Be sure to allow some of the batter to drain from the freshly dipped chile so that you don't have a puddle of batter in the oil. Less really is more in this case and will result in an evenly cooked chile.
22,Make Chiles Rellenos,9,none,10,Place the stuffed peppers into the pan.,Allow them to fry. Turn them as the sides turn a light brown color.
23,Make Chiles Rellenos,10,none,11,Serve hot.,Accompany with rice and tortillas.
24,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,0,none,1,Bring the broth to a boil.,"Add 6 cups (1.4 l) of chicken broth to a large saucepan, and heat it over medium-high heat. Allow the mixture to heat until it comes to a boil, which should take approximately 10 minutes.You can use store-bought or homemade broth for the soup.;"
25,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,1,none,2,Poach the chicken in the broth until it’s cooked through.,"Once the broth comes to a boil, add 1 ¼ pound (567 g) whole chicken breast with skin and bones to the pan. Cover the pan, and lower the heat to medium-low. Allow the chicken to heat at a bare simmer for approximately 15 minutes, or until it is cooked through.The best way to tell if the chicken is cooked through is to insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of the meat. It should register 165°F (74°C).You can also tell the chicken is done when the middle is opaque and no longer pink."
26,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,2,none,3,Allow the chicken to cool in the broth.,"When the chicken is cooked through, remove the saucepan from the heat. Let the chicken cool for 10 to 15 in the broth before transferring it to a cutting board. Reserve the broth."
27,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,3,none,4,Remove the skin and bones and shred the chicken.,"Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, use a knife to cut away the skin and remove the meat from the bones. Use a fork or clean fingers to shred chicken, and set it aside for the moment.Cover the chicken with plastic wrap, and store in the refrigerator until it’s time to mix it into the soup."
28,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,4,none,5,"Combine the tomatoes, water, chipotles, serrano pepper, water, and spices.","Add 3 roughly chopped Roma tomatoes, 2 chipotle peppers in adobo, 1 chopped serrano pepper, 3 sliced garlic cloves, 1 small chopped white onion, 1 cup (237 ml) of water, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of pepper, 1 teaspoon (1 g) of dried epazote, and 1 teaspoon (1 g) of oregano to a blender. Blend the mixture until it is smooth.If you don’t have a blender, you can puree the mixture in a food processor. Adding the serrano pepper is optional. You can omit it if you prefer a milder soup. Dried epazote is a Mexican herb. You can find it at Latin grocery stores, online retails, and in the international aisle of some general grocery stores. After you blend up the tomato mixture, taste it. Add more salt and pepper if necessary."
29,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,5,none,6,Heat the olive oil in a pot.,"Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a large pot. Allow the oil to heat for 2 to 3 minutes on medium-high heat, or until it begins to shimmer.You can substitute vegetable or canola oil for the olive oil if you prefer."
30,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,6,none,7,Add the tomato mixture and bring it to a boil.,"Once the oil is hot, pour the tomato mixture into the pot. Heat the mixture on medium-high until it comes to a boil, which should take about 5 to 7 minutes."
31,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,7,none,8,Reduce the heat and cook the mixture for a few more minutes.,"When the mixture has come to a boil, lower the heat to medium. Allow it to cook for another 5 minutes.The mixture should thicken up slightly at it cooks."
32,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,8,none,9,Mix in the chicken broth.,"When the tomato mixture has thickened a bit, add the chicken broth that you reserved earlier to the pot. Stir well to ensure that it is fully mixed with the tomato mixture.After you mix in the chicken broth, give the mixture a taste. Add salt if necessary."
33,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,9,none,10,Stir in the shredded chicken.,"Once the broth is fully blended with the tomato mixture, add the shredded chicken that you reserved earlier to the pot. Mix well to ensure that the chicken is incorporated throughout the mixture."
34,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,10,none,11,"Add the carrots, green beans, chickpeas, and bay leaves.","When the chicken and tomato mixture are fully combined, mix in 2 carrots that have been cut into ⅛-inch (3-mm) thick slices, ½ pound (225 g) of fresh green beans that have been cut into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces, a 19-ounce (539 g) can of chickpeas that have been rinsed and drained, and 2 bay leaves. Let the mixture cook on medium until the carrots soften, which should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute shredded carrots for the slices. Shredded carrots will soften more quickly."
35,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,11,none,12,Mix in the zucchini and cook for 15 minutes more.,"Once the carrots are tender, add a zucchini that’s been cut into ¼-inch (6-mm) thick slices. Allow the soup to cook for another 15 minutes, or until the zucchini has softened too.When the soup is finished cooking, taste it. Add salt if necessary."
36,Make Caldo Tlalpeno,12,none,13,Ladle the soup into bowls and add your desired toppings.,"When the soup is finished cooking, use a ladle to transfer it to individual bowls. Top the soup with diced avocado, shredded Monterey jack, chopped cilantro, diced onion, and/or lime wedges, and serve while it’s still hot.The soup pairs well with warm corn tortillas or tostadas."
37,Make Kolaches,0,none,1,Dissolve the yeast in a quarter cup (2 ounces) of warm milk.,"This is the first step if you are working with active dry yeast. It’s easiest to do this in a measuring cup, because you will be pouring this mixture later. Make sure the yeast is completely dissolved.If you are using instant yeast, you can skip this step and add the instant yeast later.;"
38,Make Kolaches,1,none,2,"Mix the yeast with the milk, butter, eggs, sugar, salt, and flour in a large bowl.","The butter should be softened to room temperature to make this easiest. Pour in the remaining milk, the softened butter, the eggs, the sugar, and salt, as well as the yeast mixture that you created. Then, pour in 1.5 cups of flour and mix everything together thoroughly. If you are choosing to add lemon zest, ground mace, or nutmeg, add that now as well.If you are using instant yeast, you will add that now. After everything is blended, slowly add the remaining flour. You may use exactly four cups, or you may use a little bit more or less. Just make sure that the dough isn’t too sticky or too dry."
39,Make Kolaches,2,none,3,Knead the dough on a floured surface.,"Lightly coat some space on your countertop or table with flour so that the dough doesn’t stick to it. Work the dough with your fingertips so that it becomes smooth and easy to form. After you’ve done this for about five minutes, roll it into one large ball."
40,Make Kolaches,3,none,4,Place the dough in an oiled bowl and let rise.,"Spray a bowl with cooking oil, or pour about a tablespoon of oil into the bottom. Place the large ball of dough into the bowl, and roll it in place so that it’s coated with the oil. Then, it’s time to let the dough rise.Cover your bowl, either with a kitchen towel or with cling wrap. Let it rise in your kitchen (or any warm place) for about two to three hours. You can also let it rise overnight in your refrigerator, if that is easier."
41,Make Kolaches,4,none,5,Knead dough and allow to rise again.,"After the dough has almost doubled in volume, you want to push it down into the bowl and gently knead again. Then put the cover back on, set it aside once again, and let it double in size over about an hour and fifteen minutes. When the time has passed and the dough has risen again, knead it, split it into two halves, and let it rise a final time for about ten minutes. Finally, your dough is ready.Making kolache dough takes patience, but it’s key that it has time to rise fully and bulk up. This creates the chewy, dense dough that kolaches are known for."
42,Make Kolaches,5,none,6,Roll out your dough on a floured surface.,"Once again, sprinkle some flour on a flat surface to prevent your dough from sticking to it. Using a rolling pin, flatten out your dough so that it is about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) thick."
43,Make Kolaches,6,none,7,Cut your dough into rounds.,"Each round should be about 2.5 inches (6.35 cm) across. The easiest way to create these rounds is to use a cookie cutter, but you can also use the rim of a proper-sized glass. Press the cookie cutter or the rim of the glass firmly into the dough, and then peel up the dough around the circle.Roll your excess dough into a ball, and then use your rolling pin to flatten it out onto the floured surface again. Cut out the rounds, and then roll the excess dough up again. Continue doing this until you’ve used all your dough."
44,Make Kolaches,7,none,8,Place your dough rounds on a baking sheet.,"You can line your baking sheet with parchment paper or grease it to make sure the dough doesn’t stick to it. Once again, cover the dough with a kitchen towel or cling wrap. Set the baking sheet aside and let the dough rise again for about an hour."
45,Make Kolaches,8,none,9,Make the indentations in the dough.,"Once the dough has risen and each round has doubled in size, it is time to make the indentations in the middle. This step basically makes dough round into a little bowl that will hold the topping as they bake.Use your thumb or a small spoon to press down gently into the center of each round. Make sure that you don’t make the indentations too large – each round should still have about a 0.5 inch (1.27 cm) rim around the perimeter."
46,Make Kolaches,9,none,10,Make a cherry topping for your kolaches.,"Mix the sugar, cornstarch, and cherry juice in a saucepan. Use a wooden spoon to stir until everything is thoroughly mixed. Put the saucepan on the stove and set it to medium heat. Once the mixture starts boiling and thickening up, turn off the heat and add the pitted cherries."
47,Make Kolaches,10,none,11,Prepare a blueberry topping.,"Mix the sugar, cornstarch, salt, blueberries and lemon juice together in a saucepan. Turn the stovetop to medium heat to warm the mixture while continuously stirring. Once the sugar has dissolved, turn the heat on your stovetop down and let the mixture simmer for about ten minutes. The final product should be fairly thick."
48,Make Kolaches,11,none,12,Create a sweet apricot topping.,"This one will take a bit longer than the cherry and blueberry toppings. You’ll need to simmer the dried apricots and the orange juice in a saucepan for about half an hour, or until soft. Then, drain the orange juice and put the tender apricots into a food processor to puree with sugar and lemon juice. Once the mixture is nice and smooth, it’s all set."
49,Make Kolaches,12,none,13,Explore the dozens of other topping options.,"While a fruit topping is the traditional topping, it is certainly not the only one you can make. Other common variations are poppyseed and cream cheese kolaches. You can even make savory kolaches with different types of breakfast meats. Don’t be afraid to get creative!"
50,Make Kolaches,13,none,14,Preheat your oven.,"Set it to 375 degrees Fahrenheit, or 190 degrees Celsius.It’s good to do this before you start adding your toppings to the dough, so that it will be ready to go once you are finished. Depending on your oven, it will take about ten to twenty minutes to preheat."
51,Make Kolaches,14,none,15,"Brush each kolache with egg wash. To prepare the egg wash, simply beat one large egg and add a teaspoon (4.93 mL) of milk, cream, or water.","Using a pastry brush, brush it generously onto each of the dough rounds."
52,Make Kolaches,15,none,16,Spoon the toppings into the center indentations.,"You only need to put about a spoonful onto each of the rounds. The indentation should be completely filled with topping.If you don’t use all of the topping you created, it can be refrigerated for up to three days or frozen to use again next time you prepare kolaches."
53,Make Kolaches,16,none,17,Bake your kolaches and serve.,"Put your kolaches in the oven and set the timer for 12 minutes. Keep an eye on the kolaches, though, and take them out when the dough has turned golden brown. Use a spatula to remove your kolaches from the hot baking pan and let them cool on a wire rack or another surface. Serve immediately and enjoy!You can store uneaten kolaches at room temperature for about two days after making them. If you won’t eat them for awhile, you can pop them in the freezer and save them for up to three months."
54,Make Kolaches,17,none,18,Finished.,
55,Make Hush Puppies,0,none,1,Preheat a deep fryer to 365 °F (185 °C) or heat up 2 cups oil over medium-high heat.,"The most common oil used is peanut, but vegetable, sunflower, or canola oil will do as well. As the oil warms to its appropriate heat, start mixing up ingredients.   If you don't have a deep fryer, don't worry. You can use a piece of bread to check your oil's temperature as well.;"
56,Make Hush Puppies,1,none,2,"Sift the dry ingredients -- flour, cornmeal, salt, sugar, baking soda and powder -- together.",Use a fork or whisk to make sure everything is evenly mixed in.
57,Make Hush Puppies,2,none,3,Finely dice your large onion and add it to the dry ingredients.,"To dice an onion, cut it in half from end to end and peel off the skin. Cut off the tops -- the long, spindly end -- from each half. Then make long, vertical slices, following the onion's long, visible lines. Finally, cut horizontally across these long cuts to get small squares.   For even smaller pieces, stand the onion up on its end and cut each part in half once more before cutting your squares."
59,Make Hush Puppies,4,none,5,Whisk the egg and water into the buttermilk.,"You want all of your wet ingredients to be together, well mixed, in this separate bowl. It can help to whisk the egg ahead of time so that it is already scrambled."
60,Make Hush Puppies,5,none,6,Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients.,"Pour your bowl of buttermilk mixture straight into the flours, salt, and sugar."
61,Make Hush Puppies,6,none,7,"Mix until combined, without any chunks.","You want a batter that is thicker than pancakes, but not so thick that it can't be stirred easily. Once it is all mixed in, stop -- you don't want to over stir. Use a rubber spatula for the best results.   If the batter is very wet and runny, add 1-2 more tablespoons of corn meal. If the batter is thick and difficult to stir, add 1-2 more tablespoons of milk."
62,Make Hush Puppies,7,none,8,"Test the heat of the frying oil, aiming for 365F/185C.","A candy or frying thermometer is easiest, but it is far from your only option. Cut a 1-inch (2.5cm) piece of bread and drop it into the hot oil. If it is completely browned within 60 seconds, your oil is hot enough to fry with.   If the bread browns faster than 60 seconds, turn the heat down. A kernel of popcorn will not pop until it's reached the right temperature, and can be used as another test subject when dropped in oil."
63,Make Hush Puppies,8,none,9,Drop 6-7 pieces of batter into the hot oil using a metal spoon.,"A normal spoon should have the right amount of batter. Dip it in cold water to prevent the dough from sticking, then scoop a roughly 1"" (2.5cm) piece of dough into the hot oil.   Only cook 6-7 pieces at once to prevent cooling the oil with too much cold batter. If the oil gets too cold the puppies will take longer to cook and will come out greasy."
64,Make Hush Puppies,9,none,10,Turn puppies after one minute to ensure that they cook completely.,"Hush puppies will sometimes flip themselves, but if not you can use a slotted spoon to turn them over. This ensures all sides cook evenly."
65,Make Hush Puppies,10,none,11,Fry until golden on all sides.,"If they look nice and golden all over, they are ready to remove. While the exact time will depend on the size of the hush puppy and oil's heat, they shouldn't take longer than 2-3 minutes."
66,Make Hush Puppies,11,none,12,Rest finished hush puppies on a plate of paper towels to drain.,"This removes some of the excess oil from the surface, which helps the outsides cool into a crisp, delicious exterior. Enjoy!"
67,Make Hush Puppies,12,none,13,"Simplify your liquids to just milk and two eggs for a denser, easier hush puppy.","This recipe is much quicker and leads to a heavier treat than the light, airy puppies shown above. To make, simply mix the wet and dry ingredients separately, combine, and then cook as shown above:   Wet ingredients  2 eggs, beaten 1/2 cup milk or buttermilk   Dry ingredients  1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup + 2 tablespoons self-rising cornmeal 1/2 cup white sugar 1 large onion, finely diced 1 teaspoon salt"
68,Make Hush Puppies,13,none,14,"Consider a denser, all cornmeal variation.","Instead of using a mixture of flour and cornmeal, get a more classic flavor by just using 2 cups of cornmeal. Use 2 eggs instead of 1 to help it hold together better."
69,Make Hush Puppies,14,none,15,Add a shredded green bell pepper for a Cajun/Creole twist.,"Green bell peppers are at the heart of Louisiana cooking, and some Cajun chefs can't do without them. To make them, use a mandolin or sharp knife to cut fine, small strips of pepper and add with the onion."
70,Make Hush Puppies,15,none,16,Throw in 8 ounces of fresh crab meat for crab cake hush puppies.,"To make them, mix the pulled and shredded crab meat into the buttermilk before adding to the dry ingredients. Cut the amount of all-purpose flour in half and cook like normal.One cup of chopped raw shrimp can also be used for a seafood kick. This recipe also goes well with the green bell pepper variation mentioned above."
72,Make Hush Puppies,17,none,18,Bake the hush puppies in a muffin tin at 450F/230C for 10 minutes for a low-fat option.,"Want delicious hush puppies without frying? You can fill a muffin tin with your batter instead of frying to get delicious, puffy hush puppies anytime. Just add 1 tablespoon (15ml) vegetable oil to the batter and stir in to help them cook.   Use cooking spray, oil, or butter to lightly grease the muffin tin."
73,Make Hush Puppies,18,none,19,Finished.,
74,Make Aguachile,0,none,1,Prepare the shrimp.,"Peel, devein, and wash the shrimp. Let them drain for 5 minutes.;"
75,Make Aguachile,1,none,2,Marinate them.,Place the shrimp in a bowl and cover them with the juice of 7 limes or 4 lemons.
76,Make Aguachile,2,none,3,Let them rest.,"Put the bowl with the shrimp in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. They will marinate better if you cover the bowl.   Once the shrimp are marinated, drain them and put them aside for plating."
77,Make Aguachile,3,none,4,Process the ingredients.,"Put the chili peppers, cilantro, and juice of 3 limes (or 2 lemons) in a blender. Process them until you have a uniform mixture."
78,Make Aguachile,4,none,5,Marinate the onion (optional).,Finely slice the onion and place it in a bowl. Cover the slices with the juice of 2 limes (or 1 lemon).
79,Make Aguachile,5,none,6,Prepare the cucumbers.,"Slice the cucumbers; season them with salt, pepper, and a bit of lime juice. Put them aside for plating.   You can also season the cucumbers with chili powder, depending on how spicy you want to dish to be."
80,Make Aguachile,6,none,7,Plate the dish.,"Place all of the ingredients on a platter or large plate.   First, place a layer of cucumbers on the plate. Then, put the shrimp on top. Cover the shrimp with the sliced onion. Pour the chili mixture over the other ingredients."
81,Make Aguachile,7,none,8,Season with salt and pepper to taste.,
82,Make Aguachile,8,none,9,Decorate the edge of the plate with tomato and/or avocado slices.,
83,Make Steak Tartare,0,none,1,Prepare the meat.,Place it into a suitably sized bowl.;
84,Make Steak Tartare,1,none,2,"Add the salt, pepper, and olive oil into the bowl.",
85,Make Steak Tartare,2,none,3,Use your hands to mix everything together well.,
86,Make Steak Tartare,3,none,4,Take about a quarter pound (200 grams) of the seasoned meat and create a ball with it.,Use both of your hands to shape the ball.
87,Make Steak Tartare,4,none,5,Place it on a serving plate.,Press it down lightly with your palm to flatten it.
88,Make Steak Tartare,5,none,6,"Repeat the process with three other servings, until you have a pressed ball of minced steak on each plate.",
89,Make Steak Tartare,6,none,7,Add the egg yolks.,"This step is optional, but if you want yolks included, here is how to add them:   Use the back of a tablespoon to press down on the meat. Make a small indent in the center of the meat. Break the eggs one at a time and place an egg yolk in the indent. Repeat for all the meat."
90,Make Steak Tartare,7,none,8,Add the garnishes.,"Add some mayonnaise, capers, and onions to each plate.   Spread some chopped parsley on the dish."
91,Make Steak Tartare,8,none,9,Serve.,Serve immediately after making.
92,Make Salbutes,0,none,1,Mix the masa dough.,Measure 2 cups (228 g) of corn flour (masa) into a large mixing bowl. Pour in 1 1/4 cups (295 ml) of water and use your hands to mix the water into the corn flour. This should make a dough that's thick like a paste.You can purchase pre-made masa dough. Just follow the manufacturer's instructions for rolling and frying it.;
93,Make Salbutes,1,none,2,Combine the red recado with water.,"Get out one ball of red recado and place it in a prep bowl. Add a few tablespoons of water or enough liquid to thin out the recado, so it's just a little thick.If you can't find red recado paste, you can use red recado powder or ancho chili powder."
94,Make Salbutes,2,none,3,Mix and knead the dough.,"Spoon the red recado into the mixing bowl with the masa dough. Use your hands to mix and knead the recado into the dough. Continue to knead (stretch) the dough for several minutes, so the dough becomes smooth.  The masa dough should turn slightly red once you add the red recado."
95,Make Salbutes,3,none,4,Portion the dough and roll it into balls.,Divide the masa dough into small balls. Roll each ball between the palms of your hand to smooth them out. Each ball should be about 2-inches (5 cm) in size. Set the balls aside to rest while you heat the oil and prepare the salbutes toppings.
96,Make Salbutes,4,none,5,Heat the oil and press the tortillas.,"Pour enough vegetable or coconut oil into a skillet or frying pan, so the oil comes 2-inches (5 cm) up the sides of the pan. Heat the oil over medium-high heat while you press the masa tortillas.The oil is hot enough once a drop of water in the pan sizzles or pops."
97,Make Salbutes,5,none,6,Press the masa tortillas.,"Place a ball of masa dough in the center of a tortilla press. Put the lid of the press down and press firmly on the handle of the press, so you put great pressure on the dough. When you open the press, you should see a flattened disk of masa dough.Repeat this with the other balls of dough."
98,Make Salbutes,6,none,7,Fry one or two masa tortillas in the hot oil.,"Place one or two masa tortillas into the hot oil at a time. They should immediately begin to bubble and fry around the edges. Use tongs or a slotted spoon to carefully flip the tortillas over after about 30 seconds, so they fry on the other side. Finish frying the tortillas for another 30 seconds to one minute.Remember to let the oil heat back up in between batches of tortillas. If you crowd the pan with too many tortillas, they'll take longer to fry and will absorb more oil."
99,Make Salbutes,7,none,8,Season and shred the chicken.,"You can purchase cooked chicken and shred it apart using two forks. Season the shredded chicken with one ball of red recado that you've diluted with a little water.You can also roast, braise, or poach the chicken yourself. Save any of the pan juices for pickling the onions."
100,Make Salbutes,8,none,9,Cut the produce.,"Wash two or three tomatoes, half a head of lettuce, and two red onions. Use a sharp knife to carefully slice the tomatoes. Set the tomatoes in a prep bowl. Chop the lettuce and put it in another bowl. Slice the red onions and put them in another bowl.Keeping the veggies separate will make it easier to assemble the salbutes, especially if people want to create their own."
101,Make Salbutes,9,none,10,Make quick pickled onions.,"If you'd like to make quick pickled onions, bring 2 cups (470 ml) of chicken broth to a boil over high heat in a small saucepan. Add the sliced red onion and let them boil for about one minute. Have a bowl of ice water next to your work surface. Drain the onions and immediately submerge them in the ice water until they're cold. Use a slotted spoon to lift the blanched onions out of the water and put them in a bowl with 1 cup (236 ml) of distilled white vinegar until you're ready to serve them.If you're short on time, you could just serve the raw, sliced onions."
102,Make Salbutes,10,none,11,Assemble the salbutes.,"Set a fried masa tortilla on a serving plate and spread a few tablespoons of the shredded chicken over the tortilla. Top the chicken with some of the pickled onion, a little chopped lettuce, and a few slices of the fresh tomato. You could also serve the salbutes with:Shredded cabbage Chopped cilantro Sauce flavored with recado Chopped hot peppers"
103,Make a Cuban Sandwich,0,none,1,Cut a fresh loaf of Cuban bread lengthwise.,"Cuban bread is long and thin, and turns crisp in the panini press without getting uncomfortably hard. You can find similar bread at a Latin bakery. The next best substitute is a long, soft French or Italian loaf (but nothing as narrow and hard as a baguette), followed by a hoagie roll.Cut it about 7 inches (17.8 cm) long, or to a size that matches your appetite.   Leave one long edge of the bread intact for a tidier sandwich.;"
104,Make a Cuban Sandwich,1,none,2,Brush butter on the outside of the bread.,"This will stop it from sticking to the sandwich press. It's easiest to do this before adding the ingredients.If you're using nonstick cooking spray instead, spray it on the inside of the sandwich press."
105,Make a Cuban Sandwich,2,none,3,Spread the yellow mustard.,"Spread about 2 tbsp (30 mL) of regular yellow mustard evenly over both sides of the bread.Almost all recipes include mustard, but you can serve it on the side if you're using extra-flavorful pork."
106,Make a Cuban Sandwich,3,none,4,Add cheese to both sides.,"Cover both halves of the bread with mild Swiss cheese.Many traditional recipes use an equal ratio of cheese, ham, and pork, but you can cut the slices thinner if you prefer."
107,Make a Cuban Sandwich,4,none,5,Cover one side with dill pickles.,"Slice two large dill pickles to make eight or ten long, thin slices (or buy them pre-cut into ""sandwich stuffers""). Lay these onto one side of your sandwich."
108,Make a Cuban Sandwich,5,none,6,Add a layer of ham slices.,"Fold four slices of very thin ham over the pickles. You can use any ham you like, but the most traditional choice is a mild, sweet-cured ham such as York ham, bolo ham, or any honey-cured ham.You can even bake a ham with a home-made honey glaze."
109,Make a Cuban Sandwich,6,none,7,Pile on the roast pork.,"Now for the star of the show. Warm several slices of roast pork in a pan over low heat, then add it to the sandwich.For extra flavor, use pork marinated in Cuban mojo sauce, or drizzle on the sauce in the pan. The sauce's main ingredients are garlic and sour orange (or orange, lemon, and lime where sour orange isn't available).You can use pulled pork if you don't have any sliced pork."
110,Make a Cuban Sandwich,7,none,8,Heat a sandwich press or similar tool.,"Although traditional Cuban sandwiches are made with a grill press called a plancha, most cooks outside of Florida have to make do with one of these options:   Sandwich press or panini maker Waffle iron, with the metal plates flipped so their flat sides are inward (if possible) Griddle or frying pan, with a heavy cast iron skillet or foil-wrapped brick to press the sandwich down"
111,Make a Cuban Sandwich,8,none,9,Press the sandwich.,"Once the press is hot, put in the sandwich and press it down to about a third of its original thickness. Cook the Cuban sandwich until the bread is brown and slightly crisp, and the cheese is melted. This usually takes two or three minutes on each side.   Remember to butter the bread or add nonstick spray to the press surface if you didn't do it earlier. If the sandwich is falling apart or a little too large for the sandwich press, wrap it in foil."
112,Make a Cuban Sandwich,9,none,10,Make a medianoche.,"The medianoche (""midnight"") has the same filling as the Cubano, but placed on smaller pieces of a sweet, yellow egg bread. If you don't live near a bakery that sells pan suave (or the Mexican version, pan dulce), use challah rolls."
113,Make a Cuban Sandwich,10,none,11,"Add salami, Tampa-style.","In Tampa, Florida, some people make Cuban sandwiches with an Italian flair. Add a layer of Genoa salami between the ham and pork to try it out (but don't tell the sandwich purists in Miami)."
115,Make a Cuban Sandwich,12,none,13,Grill the ham.,"To add a little sear, grill the sandwich open-face for a minute or two, with the ham touching the grill. Do this before adding the pork and pressing as usual."
116,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,0,none,1,Choose your scallops.,"You want large scallops which are nice and white. They shouldn’t be too wet or too dry. Look for a uniform shape, as opposed to scallops that look shredded and destroyed These are signs that they have been mishandled.Most are wet-packed, but dry-packed and diver-caught scallops are higher quality. Any of these will work. Avoid using frozen scallops for this recipe.;"
118,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,2,none,3,Remove the muscle.,"Often times, the scallops you purchase will already have the muscle removed. If your scallops still have the muscle attached, pull it off. Grasp it between your thumb and forefinger and tear it away.The muscle is a rectangular tab attached to the body of the scallop. The muscle is tougher than the rest of the scallop, making it less desirable to eat."
119,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,3,none,4,Cut the bacon strips in half.,"Lie the bacon strips on a cutting board. Using a sharp kitchen knife, cut the strips in half so that the strips are half their original length. This way the bacon will wrap around the scallop more evenly with less overlap."
120,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,4,none,5,Wrap the bacon around the scallop.,"Place one end of the strip of bacon on the side of the scallop. Wrap the bacon all the way around the side of the scallop until the ends of the strip of bacon overlap.For crispier bacon, partially cook the bacon before wrapping the scallops. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Cover a baking sheet in parchment paper and lay the strips of bacon out on the paper. Cook the bacon for 12-15 minutes until it starts to become golden brown. Don't cook it so long that it begins to get crisp and lose its flexibility."
121,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,5,none,6,Secure the bacon with a toothpick.,"Thread a toothpick into the outer, loose end of the bacon strip. Push it into the scallop, then thread the toothpick back out through the overlapped end of the strip of bacon. This will keep the bacon wrapped around the scallop and secured to it so it won’t come apart or slip off.You can also cook up to 5 scallops on one skewer. In this case, use the skewer to secure the bacon to the scallops by pushing the point through the overlapped bacon, into the scallop and out through the other side of the wrapped scallop. Push the scallop down from the pointed end toward the handle of the skewer and repeat the process, stacking the scallops until the skewer is full."
122,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,6,none,7,Preheat the broiler.,The most common way to cook bacon-wrapped scallops is to broil them. Place the oven rack 6 inches from the source of heat. Set the oven to broil and allow it to preheat.
123,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,7,none,8,Season your scallops.,"The basic recipe for bacon-wrapped scallops is very simple. Toss the wrapped scallops in melted butter and sprinkle them with salt and pepper.You can use olive oil in place of butter. Teriyaki sauce is a common variation to the simple butter recipe. Combine 1/2 cup teriyaki sauce, 1/3 cup brown sugar, and 3 tablespoons of minced ginger in a bowl. Toss the wrapped scallops in the mixture."
124,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,8,none,9,Broil the scallops for 10-15 minutes.,"Line the scallops on a baking sheet. Place the baking sheet on the oven rack and allow the scallops to broil for 10-15 minutes until the bacon is cooked completely through.Flip the scallops half way through the cook time. Remove the baking sheet using an oven mitt and flip the scallops using tongs, then replace the scallops and finish broiling them."
125,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,9,none,10,Saturate your skewers.,"When you are cooking your scallops over an open flame, soak the toothpicks or skewers for 30 minutes before using them. The saturation keeps them from catching fire."
126,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,10,none,11,Prepare the grill.,"Light the grill and heat it to a medium-high setting. Brush the grate with a light coat of butter so the scallops don't stick. Once the grill is hot, brush the grate with a light coating of oil to keep the scallops from sticking."
127,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,11,none,12,Grill the scallops.,Spread the bacon wrapped scallops evenly across the grill. Cook them until the scallops have just cooked all the way through. This should take about 7 minutes. Flip the scallops often during the grilling process so that they cook evenly and don't burn.You can tell the scallops are finished when you see them change from translucent to opaque. Cut a scallop open to check if it is finished.
128,Make Bacon Wrapped Scallops,12,none,13,Finished.,

141,Make Poutine,12,B,B4,Set the mixture aside.,"If you'd like it to be extra smooth, you can put the ingredients in an immersion blender and purée them, but this is not necessary."
142,Make Poutine,13,B,B5,Prepare the potatoes.,"Peel and cut 6 white Idaho potatoes into long, thin strings that are each about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) thick. Rinse the potatoes a bit after you cut them to cut down on the starchiness. To soften up the potatoes, you can boil a pot of water and blanch them for 4 minutes first, but this is not necessary.   If you can handle it, of course, you can prepare the gravy at the same time as you prepare the potatoes. You just have to be very vigilant."
143,Make Poutine,14,B,B6,Heat the oil.,"Pour the vegetable oil onto a saucepan and heat it up under medium high heat. Then, add the cut potatoes and cook them until they are golden brown."

164,Make Caldo de Res,0,none,1,Cut the beef.,"Use a sharp knife to cut the beef into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces. Leave some of the beef on the bones.Beef shank and beef short ribs are both good options, but you can use nearly any bone-in cut of meat. You need to use the bones in the soup, even if you completely remove the beef from the bones while cutting it. The bone marrow helps flavor the broth.;"
165,Make Caldo de Res,1,none,2,Wash the vegetables.,"Rinse the vegetables under running water, then dry them off with clean paper towels.   Scrub vegetables with rough skins (carrots, potatoes) using a stiff vegetable brush to remove the dirt. You could peel the skins, if desired, but doing so is unconventional for caldo de res. Husk the corn and rinse the exposed ears under cool water to help remove the silky strings left behind."
166,Make Caldo de Res,2,none,3,Cut the vegetables.,"Chop or slice the vegetables into relatively large chunks using a sharp kitchen knife.   Roughly chop the onion, tomatoes, and cilantro. Quarter each ear of corn and each potato. Slice the carrots and chayote into equally sized portions, roughly 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) thick. If you opt to use zucchini instead of chayote, make the piece slightly larger since zucchini is softer and cooks faster. Cut the head of cabbage in half, then cut each half into three equal portions. You can remove the core, but it's more common to leave the stem intact."
167,Make Caldo de Res,3,none,4,Puree the tomatoes with broth.Combine the chopped tomatoes with 1/2 cup (125 ml) of beef broth in a blender.,"Process the two ingredients until a thick, chunky puree forms.   You could also use a food processor instead of a blender. Don't worry about creating a smooth puree. The tomatoes will continue breaking down as they cook in the soup. If you would prefer soup with larger chunks of tomato, skip this step and add the chopped tomatoes at the usual stage without pureeing them."
168,Make Caldo de Res,4,none,5,Heat the oil.,"Pour the oil into a large, heavy stockpot. Set the stockpot on the stove over medium-high heat.   After 1 or 2 minutes, the oil and the pot should become very hot. Carefully tilt and rotate the stockpot so that the hot oil coats the entire bottom."
169,Make Caldo de Res,5,none,6,Brown the beef with salt and pepper.,"Add the beef and beef bones to the stockpot. Season the meat with salt and pepper, then cook, stirring frequently, until the beef browns on all sides."

171,Make Caldo de Res,7,none,8,Pour in the broth and tomatoes.,"Add the tomatoes and remaining 2-1/2 cups (625 ml) of beef broth to the stockpot. Stir the ingredients together until evenly combined.   At this point, the liquid in the stockpot should be high enough to cover the solid ingredients (including the bones) by 1/2 inch (1.25 cm). If the liquid does not reach that high, add enough lukewarm water to satisfy that condition."
172,Make Caldo de Res,8,none,9,Bring to a boil.,"Wait for the soup to reach a full, rolling boil over medium-high heat. Keep the stockpot uncovered and occasionally stir the ingredients while waiting."
173,Make Caldo de Res,9,none,10,"Skim the foam.If any foam rises to the surface of the soup, use a ladle or slotted spoon to skim it off.",Discard the foam and rinse the spoon.
174,Make Caldo de Res,10,none,11,Simmer for 1 hour.Reduce the heat to medium-low and loosely cover the stockpot.,"Cook the soup for 60 to 90 minutes, or until the beef is tender.   During this time, the liquid should continue to simmer and bubble, but it should not reach a full boil. Keep the lid slightly ajar to prevent pressure from building up. Stirring is not necessary during this stretch of time, but if you large amounts of additional foam rising to the surface, periodically skim them off using a ladle or slotted spoon. Check the meat after the first 60 minutes. The beef should be tender enough to cut with the side of a spoon or fork when ready. If it isn't, continue cooking for up to 30 minutes more, checking again at 10-minute intervals."
175,Make Caldo de Res,11,none,12,Add the carrot and cilantro.,"Toss the carrot and chopped cilantro into the soup; stir well to combine. Continue cooking the soup, uncovered, for 10 to 15 minutes.   Maintain the conditions of the liquid after adding the carrot and cilantro. Skim off any foam that developed. If the level of liquid drops beneath the solid ingredients, add enough water to keep the vegetables, meat, and bones covered."
176,Make Caldo de Res,12,none,13,Add the potatoes and corn.,"Place the potatoes and corn cobs in the soup and stir to combine. Cook for another 15 minutes, keeping the liquid at a steady simmer and leaving the lid off the stockpot.   Continue adding more water, as needed, to maintain the proper level of liquid. Skim off any foam that develops."
177,Make Caldo de Res,13,none,14,Stir in the chayote.,"Add the chopped chayote to the soup and stir it into the other ingredients. Continue cooking the soup at a steady simmer for another 10 minutes.   If you use zucchini instead of chayote, drop the amount of cook time to 5 minutes. Zucchini cooks faster than chayote, and it can become soggy if cooked too long."
178,Make Caldo de Res,14,none,15,Push in the cabbage.,"Evenly distribute the wedges of cabbage around the surface of the soup. Use the back of the ladle to push the wedges beneath the surface, then continue cooking the soup for another 10 minutes.   This is the last time you'll need to check the level of liquid in the soup. Add more water, if necessary, and skim off any developing foam."
179,Make Caldo de Res,15,none,16,Make any necessary adjustments.,"Test the taste of the broth and the tenderness of the vegetables. Make any necessary adjustments to improve both qualities to your liking.   If the broth seems too bland, you can add more salt, pepper, and cilantro. All of the vegetables should feel tender when pierced with a fork. If they aren't tender, continue cooking the soup until they are, checking every 5 to 10 minutes."
180,Make Caldo de Res,16,none,17,Remove the bones.,"Once the soup is ready, remove it from the heat and fish out any bones.   Most of the meat should have fallen off the bones while cooking. If any beef is still attached to the bones, however, remove the entire piece, separate the two elements, and return the beef to the stockpot while discarding the bone."
181,Make Caldo de Res,17,none,18,Serve hot with desired garnishes.,"Ladle the hot soup into individual serving bowls, making sure that each portion contains all of the various ingredients. Allow each guest to garnish his or her portion as desired.   Traditionally, you should squeeze fresh lime juice over the caldo de res and serve the soup with warm corn tortillas. The chopped onions, chopped cilantro, and sliced jalapeños can be added according to taste."

187,Make Hungarian Goulash,5,A,A6,Cook the ingredients until the mixture is thick but soupy.,"Keep checking on the ingredients and stirring them. You can add a bit more water if the mixture isn't soupy enough, but only add a little bit at a time. Wait until the meat is getting tender before you move to the next step. This should take 6 - 8 minutes."
188,Make Hungarian Goulash,6,A,A7,"Add 1/2 cup of turnips, 1/2 cup of carrots, and some more water to the mixture.","The more water you add, the less dense the goulash will be, so it depends on your preference."

211,Make Koeksisters,0,A,A1,Make the syrup.,"The night before you plan to make your koeksisters, make a batch of syrup. This gives the syrup time to chill, and the hot doughnuts will be dipped into the cold syrup to get them crispy and shiny.Bring the water, sugar, and cream of tartar to a boil over medium heat in a small saucepan. Stir constantly so the sugar doesn’t burn. When the mixture comes to a boil, add the lemon juice. Simmer for 10 minutes, stirring frequently. You can also add a pinch of cinnamon and dried ginger to the syrup at this point if you want to add a bit of spice. After simmering, remove the syrup from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature. Then divide the syrup into two separate bowls and chill overnight in the fridge.;"
212,Make Koeksisters,1,A,A2,Combine the dry ingredients with the butter.,Sift the flour and baking powder into a large bowl. Sifting will remove clumps and make the batter smooth. Add the butter to the flour and use the tips of your fingers to rub the butter into the flour until the butter has been distributed throughout.You want to distribute the butter in the flour as evenly as possible. The texture will become slightly crumbly.
213,Make Koeksisters,2,A,A3,Add the egg and water to form a dough.,Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it together with the water until incorporated. Then pour the egg into the flour and stir with a spoon to combine all the ingredients.   Continue stirring until everything comes together as a ball of dough. Then knead the dough until it becomes smooth and soft. Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap or a damp towel and set it aside for an hour to rest.
214,Make Koeksisters,3,A,A4,Heat the oil.,"Heat the oil over medium heat in a deep fryer or in a deep frying pan. For the best results, you want about three to four inches (seven to 10 cm) of oil.Place a pea-sized ball of dough into the oil.  When the piece of dough begins to cook and sizzle, the oil is ready. If you have a candy thermometer, heat the oil to about 340 F (171 C)."

216,Make Koeksisters,5,A,A6,Braid the dough.,"Take three strips of dough and pinch them all together at one end. Then braid the three pieces together. When you get to the end of the dough, pinch all three ends together to seal them.To braid the dough, lay the three strips out side by side. Take the left strip and lay it over the middle strip, so that the two switch positions. Then take the right strip and lay it over the middle strip. Go back to the left strip and lay it over the middle again. Repeat until you reach the end of the strips. Repeat this process with all the dough strips until you have assembled all the koeksisters. This recipe will make about a dozen doughnuts. If you have any strips of dough left, you can cut them in half lengthwise to make smaller koeksisters, or fry single strips of dough."
217,Make Koeksisters,6,A,A7,Fry the doughnuts in small batches.,"Place a few doughnuts into the hot oil and let them cook for about three to five minutes, until they are golden brown. When they are cooked, transfer them to a paper towel for a few seconds to allow the excess oil to drain off.When the first batch of doughnuts is cooking in the oil, remove one of the bowls of syrup from the fridge and place the entire bowl into a larger bowl filled with ice.Keep the other bowl chilling in the fridge."
218,Make Koeksisters,7,A,A8,Dip the doughnuts into the cold syrup.,"After a few seconds on the paper towel, dunk the doughnuts immediately into the bowl of syrup. Allow the doughnuts to soak in the syrup for a minute or two.  Remove the koeksisters from the syrup with a slotted spoon, allowing the excess syrup to drain off back into the bowl. Transfer the syrupy doughnuts to a wire rack to cool. When the bowl of syrup becomes warm from the hot doughnuts, return it to the fridge and start using the second chilled batch. Place the fresh batch into a bowl of ice as well."
219,Make Koeksisters,8,A,A9,Cool before serving.,"Allow the koeksisters to cool to room temperature before serving. If you have extra syrup left over, transfer it to small serving bowls for dunking the doughnuts into."
220,Make Koeksisters,9,B,B1,Mix the dry and wet ingredients separately.,"In a large bowl, sift together the flours, spices, sugar, salt, and yeast.In a different small bowl, whisk together the butter and hot water to melt the butter.  When the butter has melted, whisk in the milk."
221,Make Koeksisters,10,B,B2,Combine all the wet and dry ingredients.,"Crack the egg into a small bowl and whisk it briefly. Add the egg, oil, and butter and milk to the dry ingredients.Use a wooden spoon to mix all the ingredients together. Continue mixing until the ingredients come together to form a smooth dough. If mixing with the spoon becomes difficult, knead the dough with your hands instead."
222,Make Koeksisters,11,B,B3,Leave the mixture to rise.,"Cover the bowl with a damp cloth and place it somewhere warm to rise for one to two hours.It’s important to cover the dough so that it doesn’t dry out.  A good warm place for the dough to rise is an oven that’s turned off, but with the oven light turned on."
223,Make Koeksisters,12,B,B4,Roll out the dough.,"When the dough is ready, cover your hands with a layer of oil and turn the dough out onto a flat surface. Roll the dough out with your hands into a long cylinder that’s two inches (5 cm) thick.Cut the dough cylinder into smaller pieces that are one to two inches (2.5 to five cm) long. Arrange the dough pieces on two baking sheets and leave them to rise for another 30 to 40 minutes."
224,Make Koeksisters,13,B,B5,Make the syrup.,"While the dough is rising for the second time, prepare the syrup. The doughnuts will be fried and then dunked into the syrup right away, so it needs to be ready for when the doughnuts are fried.  Combine the sugar, water, and spices in a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium heat, stirring frequently to prevent the sugar from burning. When it comes to a boil, lower the heat and continue simmering and stirring until the syrup becomes thick.Lower the heat again and keep the syrup warm over low heat until the doughnuts are ready."
225,Make Koeksisters,14,B,B6,Stretch and fry the dough.,"Fill a deep fryer or deep frying pan with oil and heat it over medium–high heat. Drop a pea-sized piece of dough into the oil. When it begins to cook and sizzle, you know the oil is ready.  Take a piece of dough and stretch it out slightly to get an oval shape. Repeat with every dough piece before frying.Drop a couple oval dough pieces into the oil, but don’t crowd them. Fry the dough until the koeksisters become golden brown, about one to two minutes."
226,Make Koeksisters,15,B,B7,Dip the doughnuts in the syrup.,Remove the doughnuts from the oil one at a time using a slotted spoon. Place them on a paper towel to remove some of the excess oil. Poke a few holes in each doughnut with a fork.Transfer the doughnuts to the warm syrup and roll them around to coat all sides.
227,Make Koeksisters,16,B,B8,Roll in coconut before serving.,"When the doughnuts are drenched in syrup, remove them one at a time with the slotted spoon. Allow the excess syrup to drain off over the saucepan.  Roll each doughnut in the shredded coconut to coat them completely. Transfer them to a serving plate and enjoy!"
228,Make Kale Salad,0,A,A1,Combine the dressing ingredients in a jar or bowl and let it sit for at least 10-15 minutes.,"Once all the dressing ingredients are in your jar or bowl, make sure to stir/shake well. Allowing the dressing to sit for a while helps the strong flavor of the shallots to dissipate and the flavors to combine. You may also want to crush (""macerate"" is the technical term) the shallots a bit once they are in the olive oil as this will help the process along.;"
229,Make Kale Salad,1,A,A2,Prepare the kale in a large bowl.,"The bowl should be large enough for mixing and tossing the ingredients of the salad. Note that any kind of kale will do - some people prefer lacinato (""dino kale"") or flat leaf kale due to the tendency of curly green kale to be sold a bit more mature and therefore tougher. It also has a grittier texture and relative lack of flavor.Take the kale leaves and either shred them by hand or chop them up into small strips. For tougher, more mature kale, you may want to shred or chop into smaller pieces as this will help the dressing to soften the texture.Put the chopped or shredded kale into the bowl."
230,Make Kale Salad,2,A,A3,Dress the kale to suit your taste.,"You might start by adding a few tablespoons so as not to ""over-dress"" the salad. Remember, it's easy to add more dressing, but it's impossible to remove it! Massage the dressing into the kale. The best way to do this is with your hands (or a friend's hands). Note that you should gently squeeze or squish the kale as you mix in the dressing, as this helps break down the cell walls of the leaves and allows the acid in the dressing to soften things up by breaking down cell walls and fibers.Once you have mixed in all the dressing and massaged all the kale in the bowl, taste a bite to see if it has enough dressing for your liking (remember, we'll be adding a few more ingredients too!). If necessary, add more dressing and repeat the massaging and tasting process until you feel the flavors are balanced and delicious."
231,Make Kale Salad,3,A,A4,Leave the dressed and massaged kale to sit for at least 15 minutes (and up to an hour or two).,"Because kale leaves are so sturdy, they need a little time for the acid in your dressing (lemon juice or vinegar) to break down the leaves and make them softer.Note that if you plan to let your salad sit for more than an hour, you may want to refrigerate it during this time."
232,Make Kale Salad,4,A,A5,Prepare and add the other salad ingredients to the bowl just before you're ready to serve the salad.,"This recipe calls for sliced avocado, cucumber, and feta cheese. You can also add any other ingredients that appeal to you."
233,Make Kale Salad,5,A,A6,"Toss, garnish, and serve the salad.","Lightly toss the salad to incorporate all the ingredients. No need to massage anything at this point as doing so will probably turn everything but the kale into mush. You might garnish the salad with additional black pepper, herbs, and/or any other accompaniments you like."
234,Make Kale Salad,6,A,A7,Don’t be afraid to pile the toppings on.,"Because it is such a robust leaf, kale does well with lots of toppings."
235,Make Kale Salad,7,A,A8,Try a salty cheese.,"Pecorino Romano and shaved Parmesan are popular on kale salads.Aged cheddar also works, or for a salad with more of a Greek feel, try feta."
236,Make Kale Salad,8,A,A9,Add nuts or seeds for crunch and flavor.,Toasted almonds are delicious along with Parmesan and dates or raisins.Cashew pieces or walnuts can add rich flavor. Sunflower seeds are delicious in summer salads.
237,Make Kale Salad,9,A,A10,Fresh and dried fruits pair particularly well with vinaigrettes.,"Dried cranberries, raisins, cherries, or dates add welcome sweetness. Particularly in summer, also try fresh fruits like blueberries, strawberries, or mango."
238,Make Kale Salad,10,A,A11,Add thinly sliced vegetables.,"Carrots, bell peppers or cucumber are delicious, as are thinly sliced Brussels sprouts.Red onions or sweet white onions will also add a little kick to your salad."
239,Make Kale Salad,11,A,A12,Add protein for a more complete meal.,"You can top your salad with a poached or boiled egg, grilled meat, tofu, or tempeh."
242,Make Kale Salad,14,B,B2,Remove the stems from the kale and chop the leaves into bite-sized pieces.,This will make them easier to eat.
243,Make Kale Salad,15,B,B3,Prepare the dressing.,"Whisk sugar, vinegar, salt, pepper, and olive oil together in a bowl until the sugar is dissolved. Set aside."
244,Make Kale Salad,16,B,B4,Toss the kale with half the dressing and massage the leaves.,"Take a bunch of leaves in your hands, squeeze them with moderate pressure, and then pick up another bunch and squeeze again. Continue until the leaves become darker and more fragrant. Massaging helps to brake down cell walls and fibers, making the leaves softer."
245,Make Kale Salad,17,B,B5,"Add the edamame, red onion, carrot, blueberries, dried cranberries, cashew pieces, and sunflower seeds.",Toss with the kale.
246,Make Kale Salad,18,B,B6,Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 to 6 hours.,This will allow the leaves to soften even more.
247,Make Kale Salad,19,B,B7,Serve the salad with the remaining dressing on the side.,
248,Make Buttermilk Fried Chicken,0,none,1,Mix the milk and seasoning in a large bowl.,Add the chicken to marinade for 2 to 3 hours.;
249,Make Buttermilk Fried Chicken,1,none,2,Mix the dry ingredients into a large bowl and dredge the chicken till lightly coated.,
250,Make Buttermilk Fried Chicken,2,none,3,Heat the oil to a medium heat.,"When it preheats, add the chicken, but do not overcrowd the pan. You want to fry the chicken but you don't want to over-steam it."
251,Make Buttermilk Fried Chicken,3,none,4,Cook chicken pieces until golden brown 2 to 3 minutes each side,
252,Make Buttermilk Fried Chicken,4,none,5,Place the cooked chicken in a baking pan and bake at 350 °F (177 °C) for about 40 minutes.,
253,Make Buttermilk Fried Chicken,5,none,6,Place cooked chicken on a platter and serve,
254,Make Saltimbocca,0,none,1,Purchase 6 cuts of veal scaloppine or 6 thinly cut chicken breasts.,"No matter which meet you choose, ask your butcher to cut them thin, if possible. You can also thin them yourself at home, but this step will save some time and effort.   Scaloppine is also known as a veal cutlet, just with a more specific name. Both chicken and veal are used for saltimbocca, but the more traditional recipes are veal-based.;"
255,Make Saltimbocca,1,none,2,"Cover the cutlets with plastic wrap and flatten to 1/4"" (.6cm).",Flatten the cuts evenly with a meat mallet or rolling pin. If the cutlets were cut thin by a butcher you should still take this step to lightly tenderize the meat.
256,Make Saltimbocca,2,none,3,Place one sage leaf on top of each cutlet.,"Fresh sage is always best. If the leaves are large, about the size of your index finger, then one leaf is fine. You can use 2-3 smaller leaves as well."
257,Make Saltimbocca,3,none,4,Lay a slice of prosciutto on top of the sage leaf.,Pound the cutlets a few more times to secure the prosciutto and sage to the cut of meat.
258,Make Saltimbocca,4,none,5,Use 1-2 toothpicks to hold everything together.,"The best way to do this is by weaving the toothpick up and down through the prosciutto and veal/chicken. Note that some chefs skip this step, opting to be careful flipping and turning the meat as it cooks. For restaurant-quality looks, however, the toothpick is a must."
259,Make Saltimbocca,5,none,6,Place the flour in a shallow dish and season liberally with salt and pepper.,"A tablespoon of each is a decent start, but you can season the flour with as much salt and pepper as you prefer. Use a fork to mix it evenly into the flour."
260,Make Saltimbocca,6,none,7,Dredge the front and back of the meat with flour.,"Simply dip both sides of the meat into the flour, aiming for a light, even coat on the entire thing. Make sure the prosciutto is covered as well."
261,Make Saltimbocca,7,none,8,Heat 3 tablespoons of butter in a frying pan on medium-high heat.,"You can replace the butter with olive oil, but the traditional dish uses butter. Save one tablespoon of butter for later when making the sauce."
262,Make Saltimbocca,8,none,9,"Cook 1-2 of the floured cutlets in the pan, prosciutto side down, for three minutes.","When you flip the meat over the prosciutto should be browned and crisp.   Do not crowd the pan, as this rapidly decreases the heat and prevents crisping. 1-2 pieces at a time is enough."
263,Make Saltimbocca,9,none,10,"Flip and cook the second side for two minutes, until the center is no longer pink.","If you're cooking multiple pieces separately, set aside the finished pieces and tent with foil to keep it warm. Then repeat with the next batch of saltimbocca."
264,Make Saltimbocca,10,none,11,Remove the chicken from the pan and add the white wine.,Use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up all the browned and cooked bits on the bottom of the pan. They'll be loosened from the pan once the white wine hits. This is called deglazing.
265,Make Saltimbocca,11,none,12,Add the chicken or veal stock and simmer until the sauce is about one-third it's original amount.,"Simmering the sauce develops the flavors and thickens it up, making it easier to serve and eat."
266,Make Saltimbocca,12,none,13,Melt 1 tablespoon of butter into the sauce and stir.,"This will add a light creaminess to the sauce, but you can skip the step if you're feeling health conscience. Alternatively, add a dash of olive oil."
267,Make Saltimbocca,13,none,14,Spoon the sauce over your chicken and serve immediately.,"The dish is perfect right off the stovetop, as it doesn't take long to cook and gets a splash of heat from the fresh sauce. Enjoy with sprinkled parsley, Parmesan, or both.Be sure to remove the toothpicks before serving! Pair with pasta, gnocchi, or fresh bread to complete a simple meal."
268,Make Saltimbocca,14,none,15,Preheat your oven to 250F/120C.,This will keep your meat warm as you're working through multiple batches of browning. It also allows you to quickly crisp the prosciutto later on.
269,Make Saltimbocca,15,none,16,"Flatten your chicken or veal cutlets to roughly 1/4"" (.6cm) thickness.","If the butcher hasn't already cut them thin for you, use a meat pounder or rolling pin to flatten the meat. It needs to be thin in order to cook quickly and crisply.To prevent messes and splatter, cover your meat in plastic wrap before flattening it."
270,Make Saltimbocca,16,none,17,Heat half the butter in a sauce-pan on medium heat.,"Once it's completely melted and starting to froth, move on. You do not want to cook six pieces of chicken in the same pan, so save the rest for your second batch."
271,Make Saltimbocca,17,none,18,"Cook about half the meat for two minutes on each side, until browned.","It shoudln't take long, especially since your meat is so thin. Flip the cutlets once so that both sides are equally cooked."
272,Make Saltimbocca,18,none,19,Transfer the cooked chicken to a baking sheet and place in the hot oven.,This will keep the meat hot as you finish the second batch.
273,Make Saltimbocca,19,none,20,Add more butter and cook the remaining meat.,"Remember, it only needs about 2 minutes on each side to get browned. When the chicken is all done, leave the stove on -- you'll need it for the sauce."
274,Make Saltimbocca,20,none,21,Place the cooked meat on a baking sheet and top each piece with prosciutto and fresh sage.,Remove the other half of chicken from the oven and place 1-3 sage leaves over the meat. Cover with prosciutto as well.
276,Make Saltimbocca,22,none,23,Add one cup (240ml) of white wine to the pan you cooked the meat with and scrape up any bits on the bottom.,Once the cold wine hits the pan it will loosen any burned or browned bits. Stir them into the sauce and let everything simmer.  The oven should still be heating up.
278,Make Saltimbocca,24,none,25,Lower the heat of the sauce to a simmer and add 1 tablespoon butter.,"Once the butter is melted, simply let the sauce keep cooking until it is ready to serve. You should have about one-third of the liquid you started with when you added the wine."
279,Make Saltimbocca,25,none,26,"Broil your saltimbocca for 1-3 minutes, until prosciutto is crispy.","This is mostly up to you. Note that broiling is very, very quick, so keep your eyes peeled.  Meanwhile, the sauce should still be simmering, the liquid slowly reducing. If it is almost dry, add a little more wine to the pan."
280,Make Saltimbocca,26,none,27,"Remove the meat and garnish with sauce, serving immediately.","Once the broiler is off, pour some sauce over the meat and serve hot. You can garnish with fresh parsley or Parmesan, if desired. Lemon wedges are also common."
281,Make Tabouli,0,none,1,Wash the parsley.,Run the parsley and under running water to remove any dirt or pesticides. Lightly shake the parsley to remove excess water. Set the parsley aside.;
282,Make Tabouli,1,none,2,Soak the bulgur in water for approximately 20 minutes.,Add the bulgur and one cup of boiling water to a small mixing bowl. Cover the bowl with a dish towel and let the bulgur soak until it is tender. This should take about 20 minutes.
283,Make Tabouli,2,none,3,Chop the vegetables.,"While your bulgur is soaking, prepare the vegetables by washing and chopping them. Finely chop the parsley, mint, and spring onions. Dice the tomatoes. Set these ingredients aside.   Other vegetables, such as broccoli or cucumbers can be used as a substitute or addition to the common tabouli vegetables. Add one cup of additional vegetables to modify the traditional tabouli recipe."
284,Make Tabouli,3,none,4,Drain the water from the bulgur.,"Using a strainer, drain the water from the bulgur. Press firmly on the bulgur with a paper towel to remove any excess water.   Cooked quinoa can be substituted for bulgur to make the dish gluten-free."
285,Make Tabouli,4,none,5,Add in the greens.,"Combine the bulgur, parsley, mint, and spring onion in a large mixing bowl."
286,Make Tabouli,5,none,6,Squeeze and strain lemon juice.,Squeeze and strain about ¾ cup of lemon juice. Add the lemon juice to the tabouli mixture. Taste test the tabouli to ensure that you are not adding too much lemon juice. Adjust the amount of lemon juice to your taste.
287,Make Tabouli,6,none,7,"Add olive oil, salt, and black pepper to taste.","You will need approximately ½ cup olive oil, one teaspoon of salt, and one teaspoon of black pepper. Taste the tabouli as you add each ingredient."
288,Make Tabouli,7,none,8,Add crushed garlic to taste.,"Using a garlic press, add a few cloves of fresh garlic to the tabouli. Continue tasting the tabouli while adding garlic."
289,Make Tabouli,8,none,9,Add diced tomatoes.,Mix in the four diced tomatoes that were chopped and set aside. Mix the tomatoes in with care to prevent them from being mashed.
290,Make Tabouli,9,none,10,Refrigerate the tabouli.,Tabouli tastes best if refrigerated for at least 30 minutes before serving. Cover the mixing bowl and place it in the refrigerator.
291,Make Tabouli,10,none,11,Serve the tabouli.,"Transfer the chilled tabouli to a serving bowl or platter. Tabouli pairs nicely with pita, hummus, or romaine lettuce leaves."
292,Make Tabouli,11,none,12,Store the tabouli.,Put the tabouli in an airtight container and store it in the refrigerator.
293,Make Turkey Meatloaf,0,none,1,Preheat the oven to 325ºF/160ºC.,;

301,Make Taho,0,none,1,Bring water and sugar to a boil.,"Pour in 6 cups (1.5 l) of water into a large saucepan, and stir in ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of dark brown sugar. Turn the burner to medium heat and cook until the water has boiled."
302,Make Taho,1,none,2,Add the sago pearls.,"After the water has boiled, add in the ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of sago pearls. Pour them in, stirring regularly, and cook them until the water returns to a boil.Make sure that you stir at least occasionally because sago pearls are very sticky and are prone to sticking together."
303,Make Taho,2,none,3,Simmer until the sago pearls are tender.,"After the sago pearls have reached a boil, lower the heat and let them simmer. Keep checking on the sago pearls until they are translucent with a solid-looking center. When finished, the pearls should be soft but still fairly chewy.Small sago pearls take about 20-30 minutes to make, while larger varieties can take up to an hour and a half. If you are cooking larger sago pearls, simmer them for 30 minutes with the lid on and then turn off the heat. Keep the lid on and let the pearls sit and cook for another hour. If the large pearls still aren’t fully cooked, turn up the heat and keep cooking and testing the pearls until they are done. You can also pre-prepare the sago pearls if you wish. After cooking and draining the pearls, put them in a bowl, pour in enough water to cover them, and refrigerate them for up to three days. Don’t over-cook the sago, as this changes the texture and makes them mushy."
304,Make Taho,3,none,4,Drain the sago pearls.,"After the sago has reached the desired consistency, strain the pearls in a colander. Run cold water over the pearls to cool them and ensure that they don’t cook any further."
305,Make Taho,4,none,5,Cover the pearls with water and refrigerate.,Transfer the sago pearls into a container and pour in enough room-temperature water to completely cover them. The water will help cool them and also prevent them from sticking to each other. Store them uncovered in the fridge while you are preparing the other ingredients.
306,Make Taho,5,none,6,"Combine sugar, vanilla and water.","In a medium saucepan, pour ½ cup (118.2 ml) of water, ¼ cup (59.1 ml) of brown sugar and ½ teaspoon (30 drops) of vanilla extract."
307,Make Taho,6,none,7,Bring the mixture to a boil.,"Cook the mixture over medium heat until it reaches a boil. Then reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for a minute or two. By this time, you should see that the sugar has dissolved and the syrup looks uniform in texture. Stir occasionally so that the sugar doesn't stick to the sides."
308,Make Taho,7,none,8,Remove the syrup from the heat.,"After the sugar has dissolved and the mixture has turned into a thick syrup, take the arnibal syrup off the heat. Stir it with a spoon to ensure it doesn’t stick to the sides of the saucepan, then put the saucepan aside."
309,Make Taho,8,none,9,Bring water in a steamer to boil.,"Set up a steamer on the stovetop over medium heat. Fill the lower pan of the steamer with about two cups (473.1 ml) of water, then bring the water to a boil."
310,Make Taho,9,none,10,Steam the tofu for 15 minutes.,"Place the tofu on a heat-safe plate, then place the plate in the steamer. Let it steam for 15 minutes, then remove the plate from the steamer."
311,Make Taho,10,none,11,Cut the tofu.,"The tofu in taho is typically cut into bite-size pieces so that it can be enjoyed in the same spoonful as sago pearls. Some enjoy the tofu cut in small cubes, while other like to cut the tofu in long layers. If in doubt, cut the tofu into inch-long (2.5 cm) chunks."
312,Make Taho,11,none,12,Place the tofu chunks into cups.,"Dish out the chunks of tofu into a cup, or several cups if you are serving multiple people. Try to distribute the tofu evenly.   Taho is often served in clear plastic cups, though it also can be served in bowls if you wish. The visual aspect of the taho is part of what makes this treat so enjoyable! Even if you are serving in a bowl, try to use a glass bowl so that you can see the swirl of colors inside. If you waited to assemble the taho and the tofu or syrup got cold, heat them for 40 seconds or so in the microwave. Taho is meant to be eaten warm."
313,Make Taho,12,none,13,Add the sago pearls.,"Take the bowl of sago pearls out of the refrigerator. Pour out the water, and press the pearls lightly with a paper towel so that they aren’t moist. Then dish out the pearls into the cups. Include a generous amount in each cup."
314,Make Taho,13,none,14,Pour in the arnibal syrup.,"After you have added the tofu and the sago pearls, pour in the arnibal syrup. Again, use a generous amount so that every bite of the taho will include the sweet syrup."
315,Make Taho,14,none,15,Stir the ingredients.,"Use a long spoon to gently press the tofu aside and allow the arnibal syrup to trickle down to the bottom of the cup. Also try to push some of the sago pearls toward the middle of the cup so that they aren’t all at the top.   Be gentle as you push aside the tofu. You don’t want to scramble the tofu or cut it so that it loses its shape. Instead, try to prod it aside so that the syrup and sago pearls can get mixed into the middle and bottom of the cup. Mixing the taho ensures that each bite is equally enjoyable."
316,Make Taho,15,none,16,Serve the taho warm.,"After you have assembled the taho, serve it immediately while it’s still warm! Eat the taho with a spoon, and enjoy this light, flavorful treat!"

327,Make Beignets,10,none,11,Fry 2 to 5 pieces at a time (depending on the size of your pan) until they puff and brown on the bottom side.,Turn them over using tongs and cook until the other side turns the same shade of brown.
328,Make Beignets,11,none,12,Remove your homemade beignets and place them on paper towels.,
329,Make Beignets,12,none,13,Sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve hot.,This beignet recipe makes approximately 18 to 24 squares.
330,Make Zuppa Toscana,0,A,A1,Add enough extra virgin olive oil to a large saucepan to cover the bottom.,Heat the oil over high heat.Sauté the chopped onion in the hot oil. Stir the onion occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the pan. The onions are cooked when they are translucent.;
331,Make Zuppa Toscana,1,A,A2,"Add the beans, celery, carrots, cabbage, leek, garlic, and vegetable bouillon to the saucepan.","Keep cooking these ingredients over high heat.Add enough water, plus a little more, to cover the ingredients. You don't want the soup to taste too watery, so don't add too much. You will now cook the soup for awhile, so make sure you have at least an hour set aside."
332,Make Zuppa Toscana,2,A,A3,Simmer the soup.,You should do this on low heat.This will take about 45 minutes. The vegetables should simmer under they are tender. Stir the soup occasionally. Add more water to the soup if it becomes dense.
333,Make Zuppa Toscana,3,A,A4,Add the parsley to the soup.,"Sauté the soup for another 10 minutes.The soup should still cook over low heat. After 10 minutes, add the basil. Taste the soup. Add salt to your preference if it is not salty enough."
334,Make Zuppa Toscana,4,B,B1,Place the Italian sausage and crushed red pepper into a large saucepan.,Start cooking the sausage over low heat. Sauté the sausage and pepper until cooked through. Remove the meat from heat and drain the excess fat. Store the cooked sausage in the refrigerator while cooking other ingredients.
335,Make Zuppa Toscana,5,B,B2,"Sauté the bacon, onions and garlic.","Use the same pan you used for the sausage, without washing it.Cook these over low-medium heat. Sauté these ingredients until the onions are soft and translucent. This will take approximately 15 minutes."
336,Make Zuppa Toscana,6,B,B3,Add the water and chicken bouillon.,"You will need to heat this until it boils.Increase the heat to medium. Cook the soup until it gets to a full, rapid boil. This is now ready for the vegetables."
337,Make Zuppa Toscana,7,B,B4,Add the sliced potatoes.,"These will need to cook until they are soft and tender.At medium heat, cook the soup with the added potatoes. These will need at least 30 minutes to cook through. Test the potatoes with a fork at 30 minutes to see if they are soft. If the potatoes are still hard and uncooked, cook 10 minutes longer. Check with a fork again."
338,Make Zuppa Toscana,8,B,B5,Add the heavy cream to the pot.,"Stir the mixture well.You will need to heat the liquid through until it is all hot. When you add the cream, the soup should take on a lighter, thicker appearance."
339,Make Zuppa Toscana,9,B,B6,Add the kale and sausage to the soup.,"Keep cooking your soup on medium heat.Cook until all ingredients are heated through. The kale should be wilted and tender, but not mushy when the soup is done. Serve the soup steaming hot in large, wide bowls. Breadsticks, Garlic toast, or Italian bread are great for dipping in this soup."
340,Make Zuppa Toscana,10,C,C1,Cook your vegan sausage according to package instructions.,"While cooking times may vary, the method for cooking most vegan sausages is similar. Put your vegan sausage in a skillet. Heat the sausage on high. Cook through for approximately 5 minutes. Vegan sausage doesn't take nearly as long to cook as regular meat sausage. With this product, you aren't waiting for meat to brown and cook through. The goal is brown the sausage quickly. If you cook it too long it can become very mushy and grainy in texture."
341,Make Zuppa Toscana,11,C,C2,Dice the onion and garlic.,"You can do this with a knife or food processor. If using a knife, dice the onion and garlic into fine pieces. Using a very sharp knife will help this process go quickly and smoothly. If you are using a food processor, pulse these ingredients until they are finely chopped."
342,Make Zuppa Toscana,12,C,C3,Chop the potatoes.,These will need to be in smaller pieces so they can cook quickly.   Use a sharp knife to cut the potatoes. Chop them into 1/2 inch sized pieces. Leave the skins on the potatoes.
343,Make Zuppa Toscana,13,C,C4,"Combine the sausage, onion, garlic, potatoes and vegetable broth.","Stir these together in a large, heavy saucepan. Cook this mixture on medium heat. You will want to cook this soup base until the potatoes are soft. This will take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes."
344,Make Zuppa Toscana,14,C,C5,"Add the vegan bacon bits, the parsley, red pepper flakes, and black pepper.",Stir the soup well. Let the soup simmer with the bacon bits and spices for about 10 minutes. The soup should simmer on low heat. Stir occasionally during this step.
345,Make Zuppa Toscana,15,C,C6,Strip the kale leaves from their stems while the soup simmers.,You will only be using the leaves of the kale in this recipe. Save the stems for juicing or smoothies rather than waste them. Rip up the kale into bite sized pieces. Rinse these thoroughly and dry in a salad spinner.
346,Make Zuppa Toscana,16,C,C7,Add the chopped kale and the almond milk to the soup.,The soup should still be on low heat.Stir the soup thoroughly to make sure the almond milk is mixed in. Heat on low until the kale has wilted and become dark green in color. Serve the soup while its hot in large bowls with a side of toast.

359,Make Chocoflan,11,none,12,Finished.,
360,Make Beef and Broccoli,0,none,1,Slice and marinate beef.,"Take the 1 pound of beef tenderloin and put it in the freezer for around twenty minutes to make it firmer and therefore easier to slice. When slicing, cut against the grain of the meat. You can either make thin or thick slices, depending on your tastes. Place the beef slices in a large bowl and mix in 1 tablespoon rice wine, 1 tablespoon water, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, 1 egg white, 1 tablespoon cornstarch, 1 teaspoon sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Thoroughly mix this marinade with the beef and set aside for one hour to fully marinate. Do not let the beef marinate for over two hours as the baking soda will damage the meat.;"
361,Make Beef and Broccoli,1,none,2,"Add the broccoli, garlic, and ginger.","While the meat marinates, remove the broccoli florets by making a slight indentation with a knife into the bottom of the broccoli stem and then pulling apart. Do this until you have bite-sized broccoli florets comprising 2 cups. Now crush and mince some garlic cloves to make 2 teaspoons of minced garlic. Finally, grate a ginger root to make 1 teaspoon of ginger."
362,Make Beef and Broccoli,2,none,3,Deep fry.,"Pre-heat about 2 inches (5.1 cm) of vegetable oil in a large wok or skillet. The oil should be between 325º-350º (163º-177º C). You will know when the oil is hot enough when you start to see smoke or little squiggly lines in the oil. For 1 pound of beef, deep fry in two to three batches so as not to overcrowd the pot. Stir continuously. Once the meat floats to the top or changes color, strain and drain on a paper towel. Continue the process with the rest of the beef slices."
363,Make Beef and Broccoli,3,none,4,Stir fry.,"After first pre-heating your wok until it starts to smoke, add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil around the sides of the wok. Let the oil get hot and then add in the broccoli, garlic, and ginger and stir fry for about thirty seconds before adding in the beef. Stir continuously for a few minutes and then add in the sauce ingredients: 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon oyster sauce, 1/2 teaspoon sesame oil, and a slurry made from 3 tablespoons water mixed with 2 teaspoons cornstarch. Make sure the slurry is fully mixed before you stir it into the beef and broccoli mix. Stir continuously for about a minute and then remove from heat and serve. Enjoy."
364,Make Pupusas,0,none,1,Make the pupusa dough.,"Mix the masa harina, salt, and flour in a bowl. Stir it together till it forms a paste-like dough. It should be smooth, not lumpy.If it's still too lumpy after stirring, add one teaspoon of water at a time and stir out the lumps till it's smooth. If it's too wet or sticky, add one teaspoon of masa harina at a time, stirring until it thickens and smooths out.;"
365,Make Pupusas,1,none,2,Let the dough rest.,Leave your dough in the bowl and cover the bowl with a towel. Let it sit for 10 minutes.
366,Make Pupusas,2,none,3,Roll the dough into balls.,"Divide your dough into 8 balls, about 2 inches wide.It helps to lightly oil your hands before doing this. This will keep the dough from sticking to your hands."
367,Make Pupusas,3,none,4,Fill the pupusas.,"Take a ball of dough and press your thumb into the center. There should be a little indentation. Place 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of white cheese into the indentation and cover the dough over it. Do this will all the other dough balls.The cheese should be completely sealed into the pupusa. Otherwise, it will leak out when you fry it."
368,Make Pupusas,4,none,5,Form the filled balls into disks.,"Flatten the filled ball between your palms. The pupusa should become circular and flat, about 1/4-inch thick.Don't squeeze or roll too much or the filling may leak out."
369,Make Pupusas,5,none,6,Cook the pupusas.,Heat a frying pan or cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Add just a few tablespoons of oil to lightly coat the pan. Add the pupusas and cook them for 2 to 3 minutes. Then flip and cook them for 2 to 3 more minutes.The pupusas should look golden in color when they're finished cooking.
370,Make Pupusas,6,none,7,Serve the pupusas.,Serve the pupusas while they're still warm. Top with curtido and any sauces you like.
371,Make Pupusas,7,none,8,Prepare your vegetables.,"Shred the cabbage, grate the carrots, and thinly slice the onion. Place them all in a large bowl and set it aside."
372,Make Pupusas,8,none,9,Mix the remaining ingredients.,"In a small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, water, salt, brown sugar, oregano, and red pepper flakes. Make sure there are no lumps of spice or brown sugar."
373,Make Pupusas,9,none,10,Combine the curtido.,Pour the spiced liquid mixture over the prepared vegetables and stir really well. Make sure the vegetables are completely covered in the mixture.
374,Make Pupusas,10,none,11,Refrigerate.,Cover the curtido and refrigerate it for at least 2 hours before serving. It'll be even better if you refrigerate it overnight before serving. This will give it a slightly pickled flavor.
375,Make Pupusas,11,none,12,Try a different kind of cheese.,"There are several kinds of cheeses that make good pupusa filling. Consider using: quesillo, queso fresco, Monterey Jack, or mozzarella.Consider mixing a small amount of cheese into the masa harina before you mix the dough. Try to use a dry cheese, like cotija."
376,Make Pupusas,12,none,13,Add another filling.,"You don't have to just fill the pupusas with cheese. If you want to add another filling, just be sure to use a small amount or don't use too many different ingredients. You don't want to have trouble containing the filling while rolling out the pupusas. Try these fillings:cooked pulled pork refried beans jalapenos diced bell peppers ham mushrooms cilantro"
377,Make Pupusas,13,none,14,Serve pupusas with red salsa or tomato sauce.,"While curtido is the traditional coleslaw served with pupusas, you can also serve pupusas with salsa. You might also use something resembling a tomato or enchilada sauce to dip your pupusas into.   For even better flavor, warm the salsa or tomato sauce before dipping your pupusas."
378,Make Pupusas,14,none,15,Garnish.,"Add a little extra flavor and color to the pupusas by adding a garnish. Sprinkle with a little bit of whatever cheese you like, or serve with lime wedges.The acidic citrus will help cut the richness of the pupusa filling."
379,Make Natillas,0,A,A1,Combine 1/2 cup (125 ml) milk with the egg yolks and cornstarch.,Pour 1/2 cup (125 ml) of milk into a medium mixing bowl. Add the egg yolks and cornstarch to the same bowl and whisk well.Continue whisking until the mixture seems smooth and the contents are evenly distributed.;
380,Make Natillas,1,A,A2,Mix together the seasonings and remaining milk.,"Pour the remaining milk in a medium saucepan. Add the lemon zest, sugar, cinnamon stick, and salt to the same saucepan, then set the pan on your stove over medium-low heat.   Mix the contents of the saucepan slowly and continuously as they heat up and do not use a higher heat setting. Milk burns and sticks to pans easily, so continuous motion and low heat are both necessities. Continue heating and stirring until the mixture becomes hot but do not allow it to reach a boil yet. This step should take several minutes."
381,Make Natillas,2,A,A3,Add the egg yolk mixture.,"Slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot milk mixture, mixing the two together constantly to combine them."
382,Make Natillas,3,A,A4,Heat until the mixture boils.,"Continue stirring and heating the mixture over medium-low heat until it boils. After it begins to boil, continue whisking it for 2 minutes or longer.   Test the taste of the natillas after the first 2 minutes. If you can detect the taste of cornstarch, you'll need to continue heating the mixture for another minute or so. If the cornstarch taste is gone, you can proceed to the next step."
383,Make Natillas,4,A,A5,Add the vanilla but remove the cinnamon and lemon.,"Remove the saucepan from the stove. Take out the lemon zest and cinnamon stick, then add the vanilla extract, stirring it in until evenly distributed."
384,Make Natillas,5,A,A6,Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form.,"In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites using an electric mixer set to low speed, continuing until stiff peaks form.   When the egg whites are ready, stiff peaks should form when you lift the mixer out. These peaks should stand sharply without drooping. Note that the addition of egg whites is mostly found in Mexican versions of natillas. Many traditional Spanish versions do not use egg whites, and the result is a much denser custard. As such, you may omit the egg whites altogether if desired."
385,Make Natillas,6,A,A7,Fold the egg whites into the custard.,"Top the custard in your saucepan with the stiff egg whites. Carefully fold the egg white into the custard with a spatula until no visible streaks of white remain.Fold carefully, applying as little pressure as possible to the egg whites during the process. Working too quickly or with too much force can cause the egg whites to lose most of the air you just beat into them."
386,Make Natillas,7,A,A8,Chill for a minimum of 3 hours.,"Carefully press a sheet of plastic wrap over the surface of the natillas, then place the saucepan in your refrigerator until the custard is cool and semi-set.   If you want to serve the natillas in individual custard cups, you should pour the mixture into the cups while it is still warm."
387,Make Natillas,8,A,A9,Serve when ready.,"After the natillas have cooled and set, scoop the custard into individual serving dishes and sprinkle each one with ground cinnamon or ground nutmeg.   Alternatively, you could top each helping of natillas with a shortbread cookie. You should be able to store natillas in sealed containers for 3 days inside your refrigerator."
388,Make Natillas,9,B,B1,Prepare a baking dish.,"Spray an 8-inch (20.3-cm) glass baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Set it aside.   You won't actually bake the natilla, but you will need to pour it into the baking dish while it sets. Another option would be to prepare individual custard cups or ramekins.If you wish to remove the natilla from these dishes, grease them with a little cooking spray. If you would prefer to serve the natilla straight from these dishes, you do not need to grease them in advance."
389,Make Natillas,10,B,B2,Combine the cornstarch and 1 cup (250 ml) of milk.,"Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of cold milk into a small mixing bowl and add the cornstarch. Whisk the two ingredients together well until the mixture is smooth, then set it aside."
390,Make Natillas,11,B,B3,"Combine the panela, salt, and remaining milk separately.","Place the three ingredients in a medium saucepan and set it on your stove over medium-low heat.   Stir the mixture for 2 to 5 minutes. The milk should become warm but should not be allowed to reach a boil yet. Panela is unrefined whole cane sugar. You can usually find it in Mexican markets or in the Mexican aisle of a large grocery store, but if you are unable to get your hands on it, dark brown sugar can be substituted. Replace the panela with dark brown sugar in even proportions."
391,Make Natillas,12,B,B4,Add the spices and bring to a boil.,"Mix the ground cloves into the panela mixture. Drop the cinnamon sticks in, as well. Increase the heat to medium and continue cooking the mixture until it boils and dissolves all of the sugar.   You may need to boil the mixture for 5 to 10 minutes before the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar dissolves, the mixture will seem less grainy. Remove and discard the cinnamon sticks as soon as this step is complete. If you would prefer a stronger cinnamon flavor, however, you can keep the cinnamon sticks in for a longer period of time but should remove them before stirring in the butter."
392,Make Natillas,13,B,B5,Stir in the cornstarch mixture.,"Carefully pour the cornstarch mixture into the panela mixture, stirring continuously to combine the two evenly."
393,Make Natillas,14,B,B6,Whisk away the lumps.,"Reduce the heat to low and whisk continuously for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the mixture feels notably thickened.You must whisk the mixture constantly at this point to prevent lumps from forming. Scrape the bottom and sides of the pan with your whisk as you stir the mixture. Doing so can reduce the risk of burning the mixture or causing lumps to form. If you did not remove the cinnamon sticks earlier, do so after finishing this step."
394,Make Natillas,15,B,B7,Mix in the butter and optional additions.,"Add the butter to the mixture. Drop in the raisins and coconut at this time, too, if you plan to include them. Stir well and remove the pan from the heat."
395,Make Natillas,16,B,B8,Pour and cool.,Pour the mixture into your prepared baking dish and cover it with plastic wrap. Place it in your refrigerator and chill for a minimum of 4 hours.   The natilla must be cold and firm before you continue past this step.
396,Make Natillas,17,B,B9,Cut into servings and enjoy.,"Once the natilla has solidified, invert the baking dish over a serving platter and allow the natilla to drop out. Sprinkle the entire block with ground cinnamon, if desired, and cut the block into 12 even pieces using a smooth kitchen knife.   If the natilla does not release from the baking dish on its own, run a thin butter knife around the edges of the pan to help separate the dessert from the sides. Square blocks of natilla are the easiest to prepare, but you could also use cookie cutters to cut the finished natilla into different shapes. Prepared natilla can remain good for two days. Store it in a covered container kept in your refrigerator for the duration of that time."
397,Make Chicken Piccata,0,none,1,"Using a meat pounder or sharp knife, pound or cut the chicken into 1/4"" thick cutlets.","Chicken piccata should be thin, as you need to brown the outsides while allowing the inside to quickly cook as well.;"
398,Make Chicken Piccata,1,none,2,Coat the chicken with salt and pepper.,"Use as much as you desire, making sure the entire pieces have at least a light dusting. Make sure both sides are seasoned."
399,Make Chicken Piccata,2,none,3,"Dredge the chicken in flour, coating completely.","Dredging means coating it, and it should be a nice, even coating of flour. This flour will cook to form a thin, breaded coating around your chicken."
400,Make Chicken Piccata,3,none,4,"In a thick-bottomed pan on medium, heat up 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil.","You could use all of one or the other, but this mixture actually has a purpose -- the two work together to keep the temperature of the oil correct while helping each other coat the chicken and, eventually, pasta. Furthermore, the richness of butter is cut by the unique, fresh taste of the olive oil, adding a new depth of flavor."
401,Make Chicken Piccata,4,none,5,Cook the chicken on both sides for 3-4 minutes.,"You just want to get the outsides well-browned, but not burnt. If you didn't pound the chicken down, you'll want to turn the heat down a little and cook them slightly longer, flipping twice to ensure the middles of the chicken cook."
402,Make Chicken Piccata,5,none,6,"When they are golden brown, remove from skillet and cover the chicken with tin foil.",Do not throw all the pan juices out --they are essential for the piccata sauce!
403,Make Chicken Piccata,6,none,7,"Keeping the pot on, deglaze the pan with a cup of white wine or lemon broth.","Deglazing is when cool liquid hits a hot pan, which loosens up all the flavorful burned bits on the pan's bottom to start a simple pan sauce or gravy. After the wine hits the pan, use a whisk or spatula to scrape up all the bits on the bottom of the pan, mixing them in. Note, however, that you do not have to use white wine if you don't desire:   You can also use 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice along with 2/3's cup chicken broth."
404,Make Chicken Piccata,7,none,8,"If not used above, add the juice of one whole lemon and 1/3 cup chicken broth to the hot wine.","The lemon is the essential flavor in this dish, and you need to add it at some point. You can either add it to the wine as a subtle flavor, or use it to deglaze the pan along with some chicken broth for a more intense kick."
405,Make Chicken Piccata,8,none,9,Add 2-3 tablespoons of fresh capers to the mixture and stir.,"Let everything cook on medium-low for a few minutes, letting the flavors meld. Now is the time to add salt and pepper as well, seasoning and tasting regularly to ensure it is coming out well."
406,Make Chicken Piccata,9,none,10,Add 2 tablespoons of butter and whisk together.,Whisk it in so that it is all melted before moving on -- it shouldn't take long.
407,Make Chicken Piccata,10,none,11,Add the chicken back to the hot pan and cook together for 1-2 minutes.,"This is especially important if you're using bigger chicken breasts that may not have cooked all the way through the first time (though you should avoid this at all costs when possible). You can slice the thickest breast open to make sure it is completely cooked, if worried.   If you're planning on serving the chicken later, don't add it to the sauce yet. It should be simmered to stay hot and meld flavors right before serving, as the chicken will get soggy if left in for too long. Alternatively, simply pour the sauce over the chicken if you want a crunchier coating."
408,Make Chicken Piccata,11,none,12,Serve with angel hair pasta.,"A few fresh capers, a squeeze of lemon, and a dash of freshly chopped parsley would all be welcome guests on the plate as well. Top with some shaved Parmesan or Romano and you have an Italian dish worth sharing."
410,Make Chicken Piccata,13,none,14,"Add a cup of heavy cream to the sauce, stirring until well mixed, before the chicken goes back in.","This will give a rich creaminess to the dish that the original lacks. It goes without saying that this variation is substantially heavier and less healthy than the original, but it tastes incredible."
412,Make Chicken Piccata,15,none,16,Chop some shallots or garlic into the pan just before deglazing to add a hint of new flavors to the sauce.,"These small roots are known as aromatics. Shallots, when cooked, have a wonderful savory-sweetness, while garlic is welcome in almost all Italian dishes if you want it. Simply mince the garlic and shallots and add to the hot oil as the chicken comes out. Cook for 30-60 seconds, then proceed with the wine and/or lemon broth."
413,Make Chicken Piccata,16,none,17,Finished.,
414,Make a Turducken,0,none,1,Rinse the birds.,;
415,Make a Turducken,1,none,2,Bone the birds.,"This is difficult to describe, so read these instructions and watch videos below as well.   Place the bird breast side down on cutting board. Make an incision to the bone on the right or left side of the spine. Following the rib cage, cut down along the length of the bird until you reach the level of the wing and leg joints. Pop the wing and leg out of their sockets and separate from bird. Do not cut the skin. Continue following the rib cage with your boning knife until you meet the keel bone. Follow the keel bone down to the skin of the breast. Repeat on other side. Separate the skin from the keel, keeping the skin intact. For all birds, except the turkey, do the following on both sides of the bird:  Cut along the leg bone with the boning knife. Using the boning knife, peel the meat from the bones and remove the bones. Cut along the wing bone with the boning knife. Using the boning knife, peel the meat from the bones and remove the bones.   Set aside the carcasses."
416,Make a Turducken,2,none,3,Brine the birds.,"Combine the sugar, salt and water in a large 2.5 gallon (9.5 L) sealable container. Mix until completely dissolved. Place the meat from the turkey, duck and chicken into the brine and refrigerate overnight."
417,Make a Turducken,3,none,4,Make the stock.,"Put the carcasses, carrots, celery ribs, sage, rosemary, bay leaves, peppercorns, garlic cloves, halved onion and two gallons of water into the stockpot. Place the collapsible steamer basket upside down on top of the contents of the stockpot. Weigh down if necessary. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer and simmer up to 6 hours (until bones are easily broken), stirring occasionally. Pour pot contents through sieve into large resealable container. Refrigerate stock overnight and in the morning, remove the solid fat layer."
418,Make a Turducken,4,none,5,Remove the meat from the refrigerator and bring to room temperature.,
419,Make a Turducken,5,none,6,Make stuffing.,Heat the butter and 2 cups of Turducken stock in saucepan until almost boiling. Thoroughly mix with bread cubes in mixing bowl. Allow to cool until it can be handled.
420,Make a Turducken,6,none,7,Assemble the Turducken.,"Lay the semi-boneless turkey on a cutting board, skin side down. Dust with pepper and garlic powder. Coat with a ¼ to ½ inch thick layer of stuffing. Lay the boneless duck on the stuffing layer, skin side down. Dust with pepper and garlic powder. Coat with a ¼ to ½ inch thick layer of stuffing. Lay the boneless chicken on the stuffing layer, skin side down. Dust with pepper and garlic powder. Coat with a ¼ to ½ inch thick layer of stuffing. Fold the chicken, fold the duck, then fold the turkey so that the skin of the back comes together."
421,Make a Turducken,7,none,8,Close the Turducken.,"Insert a skewer along the back of the skin to keep it together. Insert a skewer along the rear end of the turkey, closing the end. Insert a skewer from the right breast side to the top skewer. Insert a skewer from the left breast side to the top skewer. Tie string to top center skewer, run it along the skewer to the left side of the end, then wrap string around the right side of the rear skewer, then wrap string around the left side of the rear skewer, then wrap string around right side of rear middle skewer. Follow right side of center skewer to end, hook around the skewer and wrap around the end of the left breast side skewer. Then bring across to the right breast side skewer, then follow right breast side skewer to left side of center skewer, then follow to end of center skewer where you will tie the string to the skewer. Make sure the string is tight around the skewers."
422,Make a Turducken,8,none,9,Roast the Turducken.,Coat the rack in the roasting pan with canola oil (to prevent sticking). Flip the Turducken over as you place it on top of the rack in the roasting pan. Rub bird with canola oil. Insert thermometer into the chicken area of the Turducken. Place in 500 degree oven and roast for 20 minutes. Drop the temperature to 225 degrees and roast until the thermometer reads 160 degrees (the residual heat of the Turducken will carry over the 5 degrees to the FDA recommended 165 degrees for poultry). Let the Turducken rest for 20 minutes.
423,Make a Turducken,9,none,10,Serve the Turducken.,"Cut off the legs and wings and place them on the platter. Cut across breast with electric knife, creating slices with all three meats and move to plate or platter with the pancake turner."
424,Make Pickled Eggs,0,none,1,Choose your eggs carefully.,"The following guidelines will help improve the taste of your homemade pickled eggs.  Try to get farm fresh or free range eggs. The higher quality of the eggs, the better the yolk will taste. Visit your local farmer's market to buy farm fresh eggs.        Since the eggs will be stored in the refrigerator before eating, you should choose eggs that are fairly fresh. However, make sure they are at least a few days old, since peeling fresh eggs can be difficult.       Choose small to medium eggs. The spices will penetrate the eggs more easily, resulting in a better taste.      ;"
425,Make Pickled Eggs,1,none,2,Place 6 to 8 eggs in a medium saucepan.,
426,Make Pickled Eggs,2,none,3,Cover them with water.,Make sure there are 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5cm) of water above the eggs.
427,Make Pickled Eggs,3,none,4,Pour a splash of distilled white vinegar into the water.,This will help to keep the eggs inside their shells if they break.
428,Make Pickled Eggs,4,none,5,"Heat the eggs to a low boil, using medium-high heat.",A roiling boil may crack the eggs.
429,Make Pickled Eggs,5,none,6,"Cover the pan, turn off the burner and move them to another burner.",
430,Make Pickled Eggs,6,none,7,Allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for 15 minutes.,"Some people prefer to hard boil the eggs by placing them in boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes. This depends upon your taste preference, since some people believe slightly softer yolks taste better.       Remove any eggs that cracked during the boiling process. These will not pickle well and should be used or eaten immediately."

451,Make Toad in the Hole,0,A,A1,Preheat the oven to 400°F (205°C).,Make sure that the baking rack is in the bottom third of the oven.;
452,Make Toad in the Hole,1,A,A2,"Mix the flour, salt, and pepper in a large mixing bowl.","For a more traditional taste, omit the salt and pepper, and use some crumbled up beef bullion granules and mustard powder. Traditional toad in the hole uses fat drippings; the beef bouillon will give you a similar flavor."
453,Make Toad in the Hole,2,A,A3,"Add the eggs and milk, then whisk them together until the batter is light and airy.",You can also mix the batter in a food processor or a blender to save some time.
454,Make Toad in the Hole,3,A,A4,Cover the batter and let it set at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.,This will give the batter enough time to set. Covering the batter will also prevent it from becoming too dry.
455,Make Toad in the Hole,4,A,A5,"Coat the sausages in oil, then roast them in the oven, 10 minutes on each side.","Pour the oil into a greased, medium-sized casserole dish, then roll the sausages around in it. Bake the sausages for 10 minutes, turn them over using a pair of tong, and bake them for another 10 minutes.The exact size of the casserole dish does not matter, but 8 by 10 inches (20.32 by 25.4 centimeters), 8 by 12 inches (20.32 by 30.48 centimeters), and 9 by 9 inches (22.86 by 22.86 centimeters) are all good sizes to start with.Use good quality pork or beef sausages. You can also use bangers, which are English sausages made from pork and breadcrumbs."
456,Make Toad in the Hole,5,A,A6,Take the casserole dish out of the oven and increase the temperature to 450°F (232°C).,
457,Make Toad in the Hole,6,A,A7,Pour the batter over the sausages while they are still hot.,"Swirl it around to make sure that it coats the entire bottom of the pan. At this point, you can also sprinkle the batter with fresh rosemary and thyme leaves for extra flavor."
458,Make Toad in the Hole,7,A,A8,"Put the pan back into the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes.The batter should be puffy and golden brown, with the sausages slightly embedded inside.","Avoid opening the oven and peeking inside, or the batter will deflate and not rise properly.Instead, turn on the oven light and look through the window on the oven door. If the oven has no window, then simply wait 20 minutes."
459,Make Toad in the Hole,8,A,A9,"Reduce the temperature to 350°F (177°C), and bake for another 10 minutes.This ensures that the batter is completely cooked through.",
460,Make Toad in the Hole,9,A,A10,Serve the toad in the hole immediately.,It tastes great served alongside some onion gravy and mashed potatoes.You can also serve it alongside steamed vegetables instead.
461,Make Toad in the Hole,10,B,B1,Cut a hole in the center of a slice of toast.,"You can use a round biscuit cutter or a drinking glass. You can also use a cookie cutter as well; a heart or star shape will give you a nice, personalized touch.   Use something that is 2½ to 3 inches (6.35 to 7.62 centimeters) wide."
462,Make Toad in the Hole,11,B,B2,Melt the butter in a skillet over medium-low heat.,Tilt the skillet from side to side to spread the butter evenly across the surface.
463,Make Toad in the Hole,12,B,B3,Place the toast in the skillet.,"Save the circle (or heart or star) that you cut out earlier. You can toast it later, after you are done making the toad in the hole."
464,Make Toad in the Hole,13,B,B4,"Crack the egg open, and drop it into the hole.","Be careful not to break the yolk. Some people find it easier to crack the egg into a cup first, and then pour it into the hole."
465,Make Toad in the Hole,14,B,B5,"Cook the egg for 1 to 2 minutes.After about half a minute, you can season the egg with a dash of salt and pepper.",
466,Make Toad in the Hole,15,B,B6,"Carefully slide a spatula under the toast and egg, then quickly flip it over.","If you can't slide the spatula easily under the egg part, or if the whites are still too ""clear,"" let the egg cook a little bit longer. If you flip it over too soon, the egg is more likely to break and ""escape"" the hole.   Don't worry if the egg breaks on your first try. It will still be delicious. This technique does take some practice."
467,Make Toad in the Hole,16,B,B7,"Season the other side, if desired, and let it finish cooking.","At this point, you can slide the toast and egg across the skillet to mop up any melted butter. The toast is ready when the bread is golden brown, and the egg yolk is set.   For an extra touch, add a slice of Cheddar cheese on top of the egg."

469,Make Mofongo,0,none,1,Heat the vegetable oil.,"Heat about an inch or two (2.5cm - 5cm) height of oil in a deep frying pan or wok to 350ºF/180ºC. If you don't have a thermometer, heat the oil until you can place a slice of plantain into the pan and it immediately starts bubbling as it fries.;"
470,Make Mofongo,1,none,2,Peel the plantains.,"This is done by making a shallow cut along one of the lengthwise ""ribs"" of the plantain and carefully peeling the skin. This is made a little easier if you soak the plantain in hot water for no more than two or three minutes to soften the skin."
471,Make Mofongo,2,none,3,Slice the plantain across its width into one-inch (2.5cm) round slices.,
472,Make Mofongo,3,none,4,Fry the plantain slices in batches until they become dark yellow.,"Do not fry them too much; if they turn brown they may not have the right consistency. You want them cooked through, not toasted."

474,Make Mofongo,5,none,6,Place four or five pieces of fried plantain in the pilón (wooden mortar and pestle) and mash them.,"Add a couple of garlic cloves, a few pieces of pork rind (the idea is to make it a little crackly without overpowering the taste), a tablespoon of olive oil, salt and pepper to taste into the pilón. Mash the mixture again. Alternatively, you can use a food processor with a cutting blade, though the consistency of the finished product will not be the same and may require a bit more olive oil."
475,Make Mofongo,6,none,7,Remove the mixture from the pilón and shape it into a half-ball (round with a flat bottom).,"If you will be serving it by itself, you're done! Just add to a serving plate along with salad, mains, etc.       If you will be serving it with some type of filling, use your fist or a large spoon to make a concave bowl shape on the rounded side, and place the filling into it.       Enjoy!"

477,Make Scotch Eggs,0,none,1,Soft boil six eggs.,"Bring a pan of water to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Lower in six eggs and cook for six minutes. Starting the eggs in hot water instead of a cold pan makes them much easier to peel.Cooking this many eggs in one pan can throw off the timing. Cook them in two batches for more consistent results.Use eggs from a trusted, high-quality source. Soft-boiling does not kill salmonella, so an egg from an infected source could cause serious illness in young or elderly people.;"
478,Make Scotch Eggs,1,none,2,Chill the eggs.,Drop the eggs in an ice bath or in a bowl of cold water in the fridge to stop them cooking. Chilled eggs are usually easier to peel.
479,Make Scotch Eggs,2,none,3,Mix your meat and herbs.,"The easiest option is to buy 600g (about 1⅓ lb) of sausage meat and call it a day. This can be on the greasy side, though, so some chefs prefer a 50/50 mix of sausage meat and leaner pork mince. You can either piggyback off the flavors in an herb-heavy sausage, or choose a plain sausage and mix in your own herbs and spices. (See the ingredients list above for suggestions.)   You can use raw sausages instead — just cut the casings open and drop the meat into a bowl. Sausage meat usually has enough salt and pepper, but you may want to add some if you used minced meat."
480,Make Scotch Eggs,3,none,4,Peel the eggs.,"Tap all around the eggs with the back of a spoon, then peel off the shells."
481,Make Scotch Eggs,4,none,5,Set up your assembly line.,"Arrange a line of ingredients on the counter, in separate bowls:   Soft-boiled eggs Meat 60g (½ cup) Flour Two additional raw eggs, beaten until smooth 120g (2 cups) panko breadcrumbs"
482,Make Scotch Eggs,5,none,6,Wrap meat around your eggs.,"Divide your meat into six equal portions, and shape each one into a ball. Dip your egg into the flour to help the meat stick.Poke a hole into each ball with your thumb, insert an egg, and close the meat around it."
483,Make Scotch Eggs,6,none,7,Bread the Scotch eggs.,Use your line of ingredients to add a crispy outer layer to your eggs:   Roll the meat-wrapped egg in flour Dip it in the beaten eggs Roll in panko breadcrumbs Dip in the beaten egg again Roll in the breadcrumbs again
484,Make Scotch Eggs,7,none,8,Fry in hot oil.,"This is easiest in a deep fryer, but you can fill a deep frying pan ⅓ to ½ full of vegetable oil instead. Heat the oil to 170ºC (340ºF), then cook the eggs about ten minutes. If using a pan, cook the eggs two or three a a time and rotate frequently so they turn crisp and golden on all sides. Transfer the eggs to a bowl lined with paper towels to drain off excess oil.   If you don't have a cooking thermometer, drop a small piece of bread onto the oil to test the temperature. Your oil is the right temperature if the bread sizzles and browns, but does not burn.The cooking time varies depending on the amount of sausage meat on each egg, and how evenly the egg is wrapped. If you're worried about cooking the pork all the way, move the cooked egg to a preheated 190ºC (375ºF) oven for a couple minutes."
485,Make Scotch Eggs,8,none,9,Serve immediately or refrigerate.,"You can eat Scotch eggs hot, or refrigerate them for later. For food safety reasons, don't leave Scotch eggs out of the fridge for more than two hours (one hour in hot weather). If you bring the eggs to a picnic, store them in a cooler."
486,Make Beef Stroganoff,0,none,1,Gather the ingredients.,"This recipe will make about 6 servings of Beef Stroganoff. This is a hearty dish that is most often eaten in the chilly winter months. Families love it, and it’s also a perfect solution when you need to serve something tasty to a group without a lot of time to prepare.Preparation will take about 20 minutes. It will take you a total of about 40 minutes to cook the entire dish.;"
487,Make Beef Stroganoff,1,none,2,Cut away the excess fat and slice the beef.,"Carefully remove the excess fat from the sirloin and dispose of it. Slice the sirloin into 1 ½ x 2 inch (3.5 cm x 5 cm) strips across the grain of the meat. The “grain” refers to the direction that the muscle fibers – which look like white streaks – are aligned. Once you figure out the direction, slice across the grain, not parallel with it."
488,Make Beef Stroganoff,2,none,3,Season and brown the beef.,Use sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to season both sides of the beef. Heat the oil and the butter in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add about half of the sirloin strips to the skillet and brown them quickly on both sides.          Remove the browned meat and add the remaining batch to the skillet. Brown the final batch and remove the slices from the skillet.
489,Make Beef Stroganoff,3,none,4,"Add the onion, garlic and mushrooms.",Chop up two medium onions and finely chop the garlic. Slice the mushrooms. Add them all to the same skillet you were browning the meat in. Stir occasionally until the onions are tender and look slightly translucent.

Add the browned sirloin strips back to the skillet, then stir in the sour cream.          Continue to simmer the mixture, stirring it frequently, while you prepare the egg noodles. Do not allow it to boil."
492,Make Beef Stroganoff,6,none,7,Boil water and cook the egg noodles.,"Bring a pot of water to a rapid boil and then add the egg noodles. Directions differ from brand to brand, so check the packaging to see how long you need to boil the pasta.   Cook the noodles until they are ready. Remove them from the heat and drain well."
493,Make Beef Stroganoff,7,none,8,Plate the noodles and spoon the beef mixture over them.,Divide the drained noodles up into 6 even portions and put them on serving plates. Pour a large spoonful of the beef mixture over each portion of egg noodles.   Garnish with parsley (optional).
494,Make Beef Stroganoff,8,none,9,Serve the dish.,"Once you’ve prepared each plate, serve them immediately. You can serve the dish alone or along with some crusty French bread. Put any leftovers in a container with an airtight lid.          Store in the refrigerator and consume within 2 days."
495,Make Pasta Puttanesca,0,none,1,Boil the water.,Use a large pot and fill it with water. You should fill it with enough water to cook the pound of pasta. Add a bit of salt to the water and bring it to a boil. It will heat up while you’re preparing the other ingredients.
496,Make Pasta Puttanesca,1,none,2,Cook the garlic and anchovies.,The garlic should be lightly smashed and peeled before you cook it. Put the garlic and anchovies into a skillet over medium-low heat. Add two tablespoons of oil. Cook until the garlic turns a light golden color.
497,Make Pasta Puttanesca,2,none,3,Drain and cook the tomatoes.,Drain the excess liquid from the can of tomatoes and crush them with a fork or your hands. Put the tomatoes in the skillet with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook on medium-high for ten minutes until the mixture becomes sauce-like. Stir occasionally as it cooks.You can also choose to purée the tomatoes or use diced tomatoes.

499,Make Pasta Puttanesca,4,none,5,Cook the pasta.,Put the pound of linguine into the boiling water. Allow it to cook until it becomes al dente. This should take about 9 minutes. Stir it occasionally as it cooks.
500,Make Pasta Puttanesca,5,none,6,Mix the pasta and ingredients together.,"When the pasta is finished cooking, transfer it to a pasta drainer and drain out the excess liquid. Pour the pasta into the skillet. Mix the ingredients together. Add in a tablespoon of olive oil."
501,Make Pasta Puttanesca,6,none,7,Serve the pasta.,"Serve it while it’s still warm. Pair the pasta with a bitter greens salad. Pass around your choice of bread and cheese while eating the pasta. If there are leftovers, cover pasta and store it in the refrigerator for no more than a few days.You can make bitter greens salad by combining arugula, watercress greens, and radicchio lettuce in a bowl. Squeeze the juice from one lemon over the greens. Drizzle the salad with extra virgin olive oil. Toss the salad with salt and pepper."
502,Make Pasta Puttanesca,7,none,8,Trade the anchovies for octopus.,Pasta puttanesca also works well with octopus. Use a two-pound (907.2 g) octopus that has been cleaned with its head and beak removed. Blanche it for five minutes and then transfer it to an ice bath until it chills.

524,Make a Reuben Sandwich,0,A,A1,Squeeze the moisture out of the sauerkraut.Lay the sauerkraut on several layers of clean paper towels.,"Wrap the sauerkraut inside the paper towels and squeeze gently over a sink or bowl to get the excess liquid out.   Squeeze out as much moisture as possible. If too much excess remains, it can seep into the bread, causing it to turn soft and mushy.;"
525,Make a Reuben Sandwich,1,A,A2,Butter half of the bread slices.,"Butter one side of four slices. Gently line the slices up butter-side down on a piece of wax paper.   The buttered side will need to be on the outside as the sandwich cooks, so when you assemble the sandwiches, the non-buttered side needs to face up. If you do not use wax paper, you may end losing too much of the butter after you lift the sandwich up."
526,Make a Reuben Sandwich,2,A,A3,"Layer on the corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and dressing.","Evenly divide the corned beef and place it on the bottom of each sandwich. On top of the corned beef, lay one piece of Swiss cheese, sauerkraut (1/4 amount for each sandwich), and roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of prepared Thousand Island dressing."
527,Make a Reuben Sandwich,3,A,A4,Butter the remaining bread slices.,"Butter one side of the remaining four bread slices and place one slice onto the top of each sandwich with the buttered side facing out.   As with the first half of the bread, the buttered side must face out to come into contact with the hot skillet."
528,Make a Reuben Sandwich,4,A,A5,Melt another 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter in a griddle.,"Add the butter and heat over medium until it melts completely.   Note that you can also use a shallow frying pan or skillet if you do not have a griddle. By buttering both the sandwiches and the griddle, you create more evenly toasted bread with a softer texture and a more buttery flavor."
529,Make a Reuben Sandwich,5,A,A6,Cook the sandwiches until both sides are toasted.,"Add the sandwiches to the buttered, hot griddle. Once the cheese begins to melt and the sides along the bottom look golden brown, carefully flip the sandwiches over and cook the other side.   The other side should also be golden brown before you remove it from the pan."
530,Make a Reuben Sandwich,6,A,A7,Serve hot.,Remove the sandwiches from the pan and slice in half before serving.
531,Make a Reuben Sandwich,7,B,B1,Place the sauerkraut and brisket in a slow cooker.,"Lay the sauerkraut in the slow cooker first, followed by the beef brisket.   If you use a corned beef brisket, you should receive a packet of spices, as well. Sprinkle the spices over the brisket in the slow cooker. There is no need to drain the sauerkraut before adding it. In fact, the extra liquid helps the corned beef cook properly without drying out."
532,Make a Reuben Sandwich,8,B,B2,Cook on low 9 to 11 hours.Cover the slow cooker and cook until it turns very tender.,"Do not remove the lid as the corned beef cooks. Doing so will release the heat trapped inside, altering the overall cooking time. If you want to prepare this dish a little faster, cook on high for about 5 hours."
534,Make a Reuben Sandwich,10,B,B4,Bake the bread until the crust hardens.Place the whole loaf of rye on the baking sheet and into the oven.,Bake it for about 15 minutes.   Do not leave the bread in the oven long enough to brown or burn. It should only be left long enough to get a little crusty.
535,Make a Reuben Sandwich,11,B,B5,Cut the bread into 12 slices.,"After the bread is cool enough to touch, use a serrated knife to cut the loaf into 12 separate slices.   Let the bread cool for about 5 minutes before trying to handle it. Cut the bread at a 45-degree angle."
536,Make a Reuben Sandwich,12,B,B6,Combine the dressing ingredients.,"Add the mayonnaise, chili sauce, sour cream, parsley, onion, relish, lemon juice, horseradish, and Worcestershire sauce to a small bowl and whisk until well combined.   Note that this will yield slightly more than you need for your sandwiches. Any extra can be saved in an airtight container and refrigerated for several days. The dressing you are making for this sandwich is known as a Russian dressing."
537,Make a Reuben Sandwich,13,B,B7,Slice the beef when ready.,"After the corned beef finishes cooking, remove it from the slow cooker and transfer it to a cutting board. Use a carving knife to cut the beef into small slices.   Slice against the grain instead of with it. Slow cooked corned beef is already tender, but if you slice it against the grain, it will be even tenderer. Slicing with the grain, however, can cause the beef to become a little tougher and stringier."
538,Make a Reuben Sandwich,14,B,B8,Melt butter in a large skillet.,"Add roughly 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to a large skillet and heat on the stove over medium heat until the butter melts.   Note that a griddle or wide griddle pan may work even better since it has low sides, making it easier to flip the sandwiches during the cooking process."
539,Make a Reuben Sandwich,15,B,B9,Assemble the sandwiches.,"Layer equal amounts of sliced corned beef, cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing onto six slices of your toasted bread. Top each sandwich with another slice of rye bread.   Each sandwich should have two slices of cheese on it and as much as 4 Tbsp (60 ml) of Russian dressing. Remove the sauerkraut from the slow cooker using a slotted spoon, draining as much liquid as possible from the sauerkraut before adding it to the sandwich."
540,Make a Reuben Sandwich,16,B,B10,Cook the Reuben sandwiches on the stove.,"Add the sandwiches to the prepared skillet and cook for about 7 minutes on the first side, or until the sides are crisp and golden brown. Flip with a spatula and finish cooking for a few more minutes, just long enough for the cheese to melt and the other side to turn golden brown.   Note that you may need to prepare the sandwiches one or two at a time instead of cooking all six at once. You may also need to add more butter as you continue to finish the sandwiches."
541,Make a Reuben Sandwich,17,B,B11,Slice and serve.,Transfer each finished sandwich to a cutting board and cut in half with a serrated knife before serving.
542,Make a Reuben Sandwich,18,C,C1,"Combine the dressing ingredients.Place the vegan mayonnaise, ketchup, and relish in a small bowl and whisk together until well combined.","Set aside until ready to use.   This is a vegan alternative to Thousand Island dressing, which usually contains standard mayonnaise."
543,Make a Reuben Sandwich,19,C,C2,"Heat the cider vinegar, soy sauce, peppercorns, and caraway in a saucepan.","Place the four ingredients in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the mixture begins to simmer but has not yet come to a full boil.   Heating the ingredients will help the flavors blend more thoroughly."
546,Make a Reuben Sandwich,22,C,C5,Sauté the tempeh.,"Add the tempeh to the hot oil and sauté for 3 to 4 minutes, turning halfway through to cook both sides.   This part of the process makes the tempeh slightly crispy."
547,Make a Reuben Sandwich,23,C,C6,Heat oil in another frying pan.,"Grease a frying pan or griddle with a light coating of olive oil and heat for a couple of minutes over medium heat.   You could also use cooking spray instead of olive oil, if desired."
548,Make a Reuben Sandwich,24,C,C7,Assemble the sandwiches.,"Lay out 4 slices of rye bread. On each slice, place 1/4 of the tempeh, 1 slice of vegan cheese, 1/4 of the sauerkraut, and 1/4 of the vegan Thousand Island dressing. Top each sandwich with another slice of rye bread."
549,Make a Reuben Sandwich,25,C,C8,Cook until the bread turns golden brown.,Place the assembled sandwiches in the oiled frying pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes on each side.   Each side should turn a light golden brown when done.
550,Make a Reuben Sandwich,26,C,C9,Serve hot.,Remove the finished sandwiches and place them on a cutting board. Cut in half with a serrated knife and enjoy.
551,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),0,none,1,Mix boiling and room temperature water together.,"The potsticker dough may reach a better consistency if the water is slightly warm.Boil 1/3 cup (80 mL) water, then remove from heat and add 2/3 cup (160 mL) room temperature water.   Alternatively, heat 1 cup (240 mL) water on low heat and remove from heat after one to three minutes. If the water begins to simmer or boil, remove from heat and let cool to slightly above room temperature before using.;"
552,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),1,none,2,Consider adding optional ingredients.,"While none of these ingredients are required to make guo tie, some recipes call for salt, vegetable oil, and/or egg.Stirring roughly 1/4 tsp (1 mL) salt (or a small pinch) into the water may add flavor. The other optional ingredients should be added to the flour instead, before you continue to the next step. Mix the flour with 1 tsp (5 mL) vegetable oil and/or 1 small egg to add flavor and help the dough stick together. Continue as usual, but be aware that the egg will add more liquid to the dough, so you will probably not end up using all your water in the next step.   If this is your first time making potstickers, you may wish to skip this step to keep things simple. If the wrappers fall apart or taste too bland, you may add one or more of these ingredients in your next attempt."
553,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),2,none,3,Mix the water gradually into the flour until it becomes sticky.,"Put 2 cups (480mL) all-purpose flour into a large bowl. Add the warm water a little at a time, stirring the ingredients together with chopsticks or a wooden mixing spoon. Stop adding water once the dough feels slightly sticky, and there is no more dry flour visible.   Depending on the brand of flour and the humidity in your kitchen, you may not need to use all of the water you prepared. Keep the extra water around during the next few steps in case the dough dries out."
554,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),3,none,4,Knead the dough with your hands until it becomes smooth.,"Once the dough becomes too sticky to stir, place the dough on a clean, lightly floured surface and knead the flour and water together. The dough should become smooth within a few minutes of kneading. Stop when the dough has no lumps and can be formed into a ball.   Add a light dusting of flour to the work surface or your hands if the dough sticks to them. Knead in more flour if the dough is too wet to work with. If you see dry flour that isn't mixed into the dough, or if the dough won't stick together into a ball, add a little more warm water and knead it in. Remember to wash and dry your hands thoroughly before you begin kneading."
555,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),4,none,5,Wrap the dough and let it sit 10–30 minutes.,"Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or place it in a small bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. This will trap the moisture released by the dough and cause it to soften.Let the dough sit for at least 10 minutes, and preferably for half an hour.   To save time, make the filling while you wait. This step does not have to be precisely timed, so return to the dough once you are done making the filling."
556,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),5,none,6,Divide the dough into roughly twenty pieces.,"Return to the dough after it's had enough time to ""relax,"" or soften into an easily manipulated ball. Pull it apart into small pieces, each one using about 1/20th of the total dough. You may find it easier if you first divide the dough into four large pieces, then cut each of these large pieces into five smaller ones.   Alternatively, you may use your hand to roll out the entire ball of dough into a long log 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick. Cut this log into discs 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide."
557,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),6,none,7,Roll each piece of dough into a circle.,"Sprinkle flour over a flat, clean counter or cutting board to prevent the dough from sticking. Use a rolling pin to flatten each piece of dough over this surface, creating circles about 3 inches (7.5 cm) across.Use smaller circles if the dough breaks apart or looks translucent, as the dumplings may fall apart if they are rolled too thin.   You can speed up the rolling process by using the heel of your palm to flatten each piece of dough into a roughly circular shape before you roll it out more thoroughly. Filling the potstickers may be easier if you keep the center of the circle thick and the outside edges thin."
558,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),7,none,8,Sprinkle each circle with flour.,"After each circle is finished, sprinkle both sides generously with flour to prevent sticking, and add it to the stack of finished dough circles. Your dumpling wrappers are now complete."
559,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),8,none,9,Keep the wrappers wet.,"Cover wrappers with a damp paper towel to keep them moist as you work. Once you have made the wrappers, it is best to fill them immediately before they dry out. Store unused wrappers in the fridge if you will use them within a few days, or freeze them and use any time in the next few months."
560,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),9,none,10,Finely chop the cabbage.,"Finely chop the vegetables until you have 1 cup (240 mL). While you can use any hard, leafy, green vegetables, guo tie are traditionally made using Napa cabbage or bok choy. Both of these vegetables are sometimes sold under the name ""Chinese cabbage.""   If you are making vegetarian potstickers, chop 2 cups (480 mL) of vegetables instead."
561,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),10,none,11,Remove excess moisture from the cabbage.,"Toss the chopped cabbage in 1 tsp (5 mL) salt. Let sit five minutes while the salt draws out moisture, then drain the cabbage in a strainer or colander."
562,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),11,none,12,Peel and chop other herbs and vegetables.,"To add a spicy flavor to the guo tie, peel fresh ginger and fresh garlic, then chop them finely until you have 1 tsp (5 mL) of each. Finally chop one or two stalks of green onion (scallions)."
563,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),12,none,13,Mix the vegetables and ground meat together.,"Mix these vegetables in a large bowl containing ground or finely minced meat. In different areas of Asia, ground pork, beef, or shrimp are all commonly used, or a mixture of these.   Wash your hands in warm, soapy water after handling raw meat to reduce the risk of exposure to harmful bacteria. Clean any surfaces or utensils that came into contact with the meat in hot, soapy water once you are done using them."
564,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),13,none,14,Add seasonings.,"Mix in 2 tsp (10 mL) soy sauce, 2 tsp (20 mL) sesame oil or Chinese cooking wine, and 1/2 tsp (2.5 mL) pepper. There are many variations on this recipe, and you may decide to replace some seasonings or add your own. Other common options include 1/4 cup (60 mL) chicken stock or chicken broth, a dash of chili powder, or a dash of Chinese five spice powder.If you'd like to adjust the seasonings before you make the potstickers, take a small spoonful of filling and fry it in oil until it is browned through. Taste the filling and add more seasoning if necessary."
565,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),14,none,15,Hold a potsticker wrapper on the palm of your non-dominant hand.,Take one of your circular potsticker wrappings and place it on the palm of the hand you use least.
566,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),15,none,16,Place the filling in the potsticker wrapper.,"Take approximately 1/2–1 tablespoon (7–15 mL) of filling using a spoon or chopsticks and place in the center of the potsticker wrapper. If the dough is thin or the circles of dough are small, use less filling."
567,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),16,none,17,Fold the wrapper loosely around the filling.,"Fold the potsticker in half to make a half-moon shape, but do not press the edges completely together. Only press the center of the edges together, so the corners of the dumpling are still unattached.    Note: If you are using storebought dumpling wrappers, use wet fingers to dampen the edges until they are soft enough to press together."
568,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),17,none,18,Fold a piece of dough at one corner.,"Grasp one layer of dough at the corner with your index finger and thumb, then fold it toward the center of the potsticker edge, where the two sides of the circle are pressed together.The soft dough should stretch into a classic potsticker pleat or wrinkle. Press the two layers of dough together at the fold to keep it in place."
569,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),18,none,19,Repeat until there are three or four folds on each side.,"Using the same technique, grasp one layer of dough at the corner and fold it over toward the center edge. Press together with the opposite layer of the potsticker. Repeat this until there are three or four folds on each potsticker, and the potsticker is completely closed."
570,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),19,none,20,Heat a pan of oil.,"Add cooking oil to a wok, flat skillet, or frying pan, just enough to cover the bottom of the pan in a thin layer. Heat over medium heat until the oil begins to shimmer, or when a small piece of vegetable or filling sizzles when placed in the oil.   Use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point, such as canola oil or peanut oil."
571,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),20,none,21,Add the potstickers to the hot oil.,"Carefully drop the potstickers into the pan from a short distance above the oil. Arrange them with a heat-safe utensil so the dumplings are close together but do not touch each other.You will likely need to cook your potstickers in several batches. Do not pile potstickers on top of each other in the pan, or they may not cook properly."
572,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),21,none,22,Reduce heat and cover the pan.,"Cover the pan, reduce to low heat, and fry for a few minutes until the bottom of the potstickers are crisp and golden-brown. Depending on the temperature of the pan, this could take anywhere from two to seven minutes.You may lift the lid to check on the potstickers' progress.   Remove from heat immediately if you smell burning. Use a heat-safe utensil to unstick the potstickers from the pan, and continue after one or two minutes."
573,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),22,none,23,Add a small amount of water to the pan.,"Once one side of the potstickers are brown, lift the lid and pour 1–3 tablespoons (15–45 mL) water onto the pan, just enough to cover the base of the pan with a shallow layer.   Pour the water while rapidly moving in a circular motion around the edge of the pan. This distributes the water evenly and prevents one part of the pan from cooling down too quickly. This also reduces splatter from hot oil and water coming into contact."
574,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),23,none,24,Cover and cook for a few minutes more.,Cover the pan again and cook on moderate or low heat for 4-5 minutes. Add more water if it boils away before the potstickers are done cooking. Note that you do not need to flip the potstickers at any point in this process; it is intentional that they are only crisp on one side.   Remove a potsticker and cut it open to check that it is done. The filling inside should be browned and fully cooked.
575,Make Potstickers (Guo Tie),24,none,25,Serve immediately with dipping sauce.,"Remove the potstickers from the pan and cook additional batches if necessary. Once all the potstickers are cooked, serve them with a sauce of your choice:   Any dark vinegar can be used alone or mixed with an equal amount of soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil. Mix vinegar with sherry or dry wine and sweet soy sauce for a sweeter dipping sauce. Black pepper and sliced ginger add a sophisticated flavor, and can be provided with or without a dipping sauce."

593,Make Russian Salad,9,B,B4,Chop the rest of the ingredients.,"Take the potatoes, apples, carrots, and pineapple and cut them into cubes. Make sure to remove the seeds from the apples.

610,Make Sandwich Wraps,0,none,1,Choose your ingredients.,"The next time you're at the market, look for foods you like. A good rule of thumb is that if they would work well in a sandwich, they would work well in a wrap, but because a wrap is enclosed, you can also include things that might not handle well on a sandwich.;"
611,Make Sandwich Wraps,1,none,2,Lay out a tortilla.,"The anchor for a good wrap is usually a large flour tortilla, though you can use corn if you prefer them. You may be able to find colorful variations that include things like tomatoes or spinach. If you don't want to buy tortillas, or you can't find them, remember that you can also make your own.

612,Make Sandwich Wraps,2,none,3,"Add meats, if you eat them.","You can use cold cuts or you can prepare your own meat by grilling, pan-frying, or any other method you want. Don't forget to season the meat if you're cooking it yourself. Chicken, turkey, beef, ham, and pork are casual options."
613,Make Sandwich Wraps,3,none,4,"Add seafood, if you like it.","Shrimp and fish make good, lighter additions to wraps. You can also use canned tuna or salmon, inside or outside of a tuna salad mixture.   Generally, use meats or seafood. Seafood tends to have more of a delicate flavor and texture that can be overwhelmed by heavier meats."
614,Make Sandwich Wraps,4,none,5,"Add veggies, pile them high.","The sky is the limit, metaphorically, so try all kinds of things. This is a great way to pack some delicious nutrition into a compact package. You can make an entire portable salad right there inside the tortilla if you want.

615,Make Sandwich Wraps,5,none,6,"Try fruits, fresh or dried.","While they're not as frequent an addition to sandwiches or salads, you may find you like the bit of sweetness or tartness that fruits add.

664,Prepare Mashed Potatoes,1,A,A2,Boil the potatoes in a large pot of water.,"First, boil the water by itself, adding a pinch of salt. The pot should be large enough to comfortably hold the potatoes without crowding them. Once the water begins to boil, add the potatoes and cook them covered for 15-20 minutes, or until they are soft.

665,Prepare Mashed Potatoes,2,A,A3,Mash the potatoes as you add the other ingredients.,"Begin to mash the potatoes and add 2 tablespoon (29.6 ml). of melted butter and 1/2 cup of milk along the way. This will make them taste richer and creamier and will make them easier to mash as well. A potato masher is ideal for mashing potatoes, but you can also use a large fork, a whisk, or a wooden spoon.   You can also mash potatoes with the following tools: a wire masher, a stainless steel masher, a ricer, or an electric mixer.

Add the egg yolk, lemon juice, and mustard, whisking well to combine.   Only use egg yolks from pasteurized eggs. There's no heat involved in this recipe, so the yolks won't be cooked."
701,Make Caesar Salad Dressing,2,A,A3,Gradually whisk in the oil.,"Pour a thin stream of olive oil into the mixture, whisking simultaneously. Continue whisking until the dressing becomes thick and glossy.   The ingredients should be fully emulsified, forming a consistently thick dressing.If you are unable to pour and whisk simultaneously, add the oil 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time and whisk well after each addition. Adding the oil too quickly can make it difficult to blend into the rest of the ingredients."

Taste the dressing at this stage and adjust the seasonings as desired."

815,Make Zucchini Pancakes,11,C,C3,Combine the zucchini pancake batter and preheat the griddle.,"Heat your griddle to medium. Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a rubber spatula to stir the batter until the dry ingredients are just mixed into the wet ingredients. Carefully fold in the grated zucchini.To fold the zucchini, gently use a twisting motion with your wrist as you incorporate the zucchini into the batter. The goal is to keep the volume, so don't over mix the batter."
816,Make Zucchini Pancakes,12,C,C4,Cook the breakfast zucchini pancakes.,"Spray the griddle with cooking spray right before you're ready to cook the pancakes. Once the griddle is hot, pour 1/2 cup (about 175 g) of batter onto the griddle. Cook the pancakes until the edges look dry and bubbles appear and burst on the surface of the pancakes.

828,Make Almond Flour or Meal,0,A,A1,"Take any amount of blanched almonds, preferably sprouted.","Any amount of almonds will do because the ingredients start and end with almonds. Nifty! Why blanched almonds for almond flour? Blanched almonds are simply almonds without their outer skin. These make for a more uniform-colored flour and a more even taste.          In order to blanch almonds, boil them for about a minute or two, uncovered. Use a cloth or your hand by rubbing the skin off or removing nut from the shell. Completely dry the almonds before using, as the water will make it into butter. Why sprouted? Sprouted almonds simply mean almonds that are soaked overnight. They are easier for the human body to digest, making your overall experience more pleasant. Specifically, sprouting takes away toxic enzyme inhibitors so that the enzymes your body deploys during digestion can do their job.;"
829,Make Almond Flour or Meal,1,A,A2,"Once dry, place any amount of almonds inside a food processor, coffee bean grinder, Vitamix, or blender.","Again, it doesn't matter how many almonds you use.

830,Make Almond Flour or Meal,2,A,A3,"Pulse until you get a fine, grainy consistency.","This usually takes anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute, perhaps longer depending on your pulsing apparatus.

832,Make Almond Flour or Meal,4,B,B1,"Place any amount of sprouted almonds in a food processor, coffee bean grinder, Vitamix, or blender.","While there is no official difference between almond flour and almond meal, the unofficial difference is that flour contains blanched almonds and meal contains almonds with the skins still intact.Therefore, if you decide to make almond meal or have a recipe that calls for meal, it may be preferable to make it using whole, sprouted almonds instead of blanched, sprouted almonds."
833,Make Almond Flour or Meal,5,B,B2,Pulse the almonds in the food processor for less time than you might have making almond flour.,"Almond meal is generally (again, unofficially) supposed to be coarser than almond flour.

1015,Make Pumpkin Puree,0,none,1,Get small pie or sugar pumpkins.,"You can make pumpkin puree out of any type of pumpkin, but for the most concentrated flavor (and the best for making pie), go for the smaller pumpkins that are intended to be used in recipes, rather than choose jack-o-lantern sized squash. Each pumpkin will yield a cup or so of puree.   Look for pumpkins with bright orange flesh, no big bruises or gouges, and a relatively uniform shape. Heirloom pumpkins often have striated colors like yellow and green in addition to orange. These make great puree, too, but the color may not be the classic bright orange you're used to. Avoid decorative baby pumpkins - these don't contain enough meat to make much pumpkin puree, and they aren't grown to be eaten.;"

1021,Make Pumpkin Puree,6,none,7,Place the pumpkin wedges on a baking sheet.,"Space them evenly along the baking sheet, skin-side down. Try not to let any of the wedges touch, since they won't cook as evenly that way. There's no need to drizzle oil on the wedges; the puree should have no ingredients aside from pure pumpkin if you plan on using it in a recipe later."
1022,Make Pumpkin Puree,7,none,8,Roast the wedges.,"Place the baking sheet in the oven and let the wedges bake for about 40 minutes. When the wedges are finished, you should be able to easily slide a fork through the flesh. Remove them from the oven and let them cool.   Don't roast the wedges until they turn brown; this affects the flavor of the puree. They should be roasted until they're just cooked through. Pour some water into the baking tray with the wedges to prevent them from overcooking. The water will create steam as it heats up, helping the pumpkin cook evenly without browning."
1023,Make Pumpkin Puree,8,none,9,Peel the wedges.,"Once the wedges are cool enough to handle, it's time to peel the skin away from the flesh. Use your fingers to lift the skin off of the pumpkin meat. It should come off quite easily. You can use a fork to help you separate the skin if necessary. Put the pumpkin meat into a bowl and discard the skin."
1024,Make Pumpkin Puree,9,none,10,Puree the pumpkin flesh.,"Place it in a food processor and pulse it until it's completely smooth. Check to make sure there are no remaining lumps.

If the pumpkin puree seems too wet, strain it through cheesecloth before storing."

You've done the hard part by making the puree; all that's left to create a delectable pumpkin pie filling is adding the right spices and a few more ingredients.To make enough filling for one pie, mix 3 cups of pumpkin puree with the following ingredients, then pour it into a pie crust:   6 eggs 1 tablespoon cream 1 1/2 cups brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 3 cups evaporated milk 1 teaspoon vanilla"

1077,Cook Boneless Pork Chops,8,B,B2,Season your pork chops.,"You can keep it simple, with a bit of salt and pepper only, you can add additional herbs, spices and vegetables to bake with the pork or you can apply a breading.

1103,Cook Squid,0,A,A1,Know that whole squid are cheaper and tastier than pre-cut calamari.,"There are a lot of parts to a squid that are thrown out when a squid is pre-prepared. It may seem gross at first, but prepping a whole squid requires nothing but a sharp knife and a willingness to get your hands dirty."
1104,Cook Squid,1,A,A2,Pinch between the eyes and body and pull the head out of the mantle.,"This is probably the grossest part of the whole process, and you get it done first. Hold the squid firmly by the body, or mantle. Squeeze gently above the eyes and pull towards the tentacles so that you have two parts -- the head and tentacles and the mantle.   This may get messy, so do it over the sink when possible."
1105,Cook Squid,2,A,A3,Chop the head off the tentacles by cutting beneath the eyes.,"Discard the eyes and head, keeping the tentacles for later. If you want to save the ink, which is great in stews or pasta, it is attached above the head and is a silvery sack with black liquid inside. Cut it away and drain the ink into a bowl to use later."
1106,Cook Squid,3,A,A4,Remove the beak from the tentacles by pinching it out from the center.,"The hard mouth of the squid sits in the middle of the tentacle cluster. Feel around for a small, seed like beak at the base of the tentacles. It can be popped out by squeezing out in the direction of the tentacles.   Cut any extra long tentacles back so that they are all roughly even length and then set the tentacles aside-- they are ready to cook and serve."
1107,Cook Squid,4,A,A5,Pull off the two fins.,"You can trim them back with a knife as well, but pulling them off will weaken the skin, which you need to remove later. Pull back the fins (they look like wings on the body) then pinch them with your thumb and forefinger until have a good grip. You can then easily pull them off the body of the squid."
1108,Cook Squid,5,A,A6,"Pull out the hard piece of cartilage, or quill from inside the body of the squid.","You should be able to feel it easily in the mantle of the squid along the belly, and it will slide out easily. It may break inside the squid, so make sure to feel for any hard bits before you begin cooking."
1109,Cook Squid,6,A,A7,Use the back of your knife to squeeze any remaining viscera out of the squid body.,"Starting at the tip, use the back of your knife to push the remaining gunk out of the mantle. If you're feeling adventurous, it is often easier to just reach in with your hands or a spoon and simply scoop it all out."
1110,Cook Squid,7,A,A8,Remove the membrane.,"The membrane is the gel-like, purple skin covering the squid. Cut the tip off the mantle and use it to get some skin loose, then pull it away. If you are having trouble, scrape the blade of the knife at an angle along the skin, almost like you were gently whittling. Rinse the squid in cold water when you're done."
1111,Cook Squid,8,A,A9,Cut the mantle into your desired shape.,"If you want calamari, cut the mantle horizontally so that you have rings of squid. For most other servings, cut along one edge of the squid to open it up into a flat piece and then cut into squares.You can also score the fish for faster cooking. Make small slices halfway into the flesh with your knife at an angle so that the squid is ridged."
1112,Cook Squid,9,B,B1,Pat your rings of squid dry with a paper towel.,"Calamari requires thin rings of squid. If you start with the body of the squid, simply pat it dry and then cut horizontally across the body with a sharp knife -- turning the tube of seafood into 1/2"" rings for cooking.   1 lb of fresh squid usually equals 1/2 lb of calamari, which is generally enough for one person."
1115,Cook Squid,12,B,B4,Coat the rings of calamari in the flour mixture.,"Coat the rings so that each of them is completely covered in flower. You may need to work in small batches, and you'll likely need to add more flour if you start running out."
1116,Cook Squid,13,B,B5,"Heat up 1/2"" oil to medium-high heat on the stove top.","You may need 1-2 cups of vegetable oil in order to have enough, as it should almost coat the rings when they cook. If you have a thermometer, get the oil up to 360℉. You can also use a deep-fryer set to 360℉. If you don't have a thermometer, wait until the oil is shimmering throughout."
1117,Cook Squid,14,B,B6,"Cook the calamari in small batches until golden brown, about 2-3 minutes.","Flip the rings once as they cook, removing them when the flesh underneath the breading is no longer shiny or translucent. Make sure you don't crowd the pan, adding only enough pieces to fill the bottom without touching or overlapping. Adding too much will drastically lower the temperature of the oil, leading to greasy, unappealing calamari.If you want crispier calamari with a smoother inside, heat the oil to 400℉ and cook the squid for no more than a minute or a minute and a half."
1118,Cook Squid,15,C,C1,"Pan fry cut squid with some seasonings for a quick, delicious meal or appetizer.","Squid only needs to cook for 30-45 seconds, and it's tender, mild flavor works with a variety of spices. Start with cleaned tentacles and the body of the squid flattened and cut into 1-2"" squares."
1119,Cook Squid,16,C,C2,Heat up 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a pan on medium-high heat.,You want the oil to be hot so that the squid cooks quickly. Leaving the meat in the oil for too long will make it tough and rubbery.
1120,Cook Squid,17,C,C3,Cook any aromatics in the oil for 1-2 minutes.,"Aromatics are simply small vegetables and herbs that soften under heat and are used in cuisines worldwide. Toss them in the hot oil and give them a few minutes to get tender before moving on. Some good ideas (listed per squid being cooked) include:   1-2 glove garlic, minced. 1/4 cup diced white onions. 1/3 cup diced chili peppers."
1121,Cook Squid,18,C,C4,Add a small batch of squid and cook for 30 seconds.,"You do not want to fill the pan, or you'll lower the temperature too fast and ruin the cooking process. Put enough pieces in so that they have room to move and stir frequently. If you have a large sauce-pan, 1 whole squid should be perfect."
1122,Cook Squid,19,C,C5,Add any seasonings and toss for another 10-25 seconds before removing.,"You only want the squid to cook until it is white and no longer translucent (partially see-through). Then, add your spices and mix everything up well before serving immediately. You can mix it into pasta or simply eat it as is. Try out:   1 tablespoons of soy sauce and a handful of chopped coriander A pinch of salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste. Salt, black pepper, and the squid's own ink."

1178,Make Cornmeal,0,none,1,Choose the corn.,"You can use nearly any type of corn as long as the kernels have been properly and thoroughly dried.This tutorial covers the process for whole kernel frozen corn.   The easiest option, however, would be to use uncooked popcorn kernels. You won't need to dehydrate popcorn since it's already adequately dry. Use the same amount of popcorn to kernel corn, and skip directly to the ""Grinding"" instructions. You can also use nearly any variety of home-grown corn if you're feeling more adventurous, but the process can be more time consuming since you'll need to dry it on the stalk. Field or dent corn is the preferred variety for this method, but sweet corn could be used, as well.;"
1179,Make Cornmeal,1,none,2,Obtain a grinding device.,"Electric and hand-operated grain mills are the probably your best options since they'll allow you the greatest degree of control for your effort.   Note that hand-operated grain mills may require considerable strength to use, especially when grinding something as large and coarse as corn. For small amounts, you could use a mortar and pestle, spice grinder, or coffee grinder.If you don't have an actual grain mill, high-powered blenders (Blendtec, Vitamix, etc.) may also work.Standard blenders are not strong enough, though, so you should avoid using one for this process."
1180,Make Cornmeal,2,none,3,Spread the corn over the dehydrator tray.,"Open one 16-oz (450-g) bag of frozen corn kernels. Spread the corn over one dehydrator tray, keeping it in an even layer.   You can dry the corn directly from its frozen state. If some of the kernels are fixed together by ice, though, gently tap the chunks of corn on your counter or table to break them apart."
1182,Make Cornmeal,4,none,5,Dehydrate the corn for at least 6 hours.,"Check the corn kernels after 6 hours pass. Remove it from the dehydrator if it's completely dry; otherwise, continue dehydrating the corn as needed, checking it every 30 to 60 minutes.   To check the status of the corn, take a few kernels and try to manipulate them between your fingers. Properly dried kernels should no longer feel pliable If the corn doesn't feel pliable anymore, perform a second test by dropping a few kernels on a hard surface, like a counter or table. They should make a distinctive ""click"" sound when ready."
1184,Make Cornmeal,6,none,7,Pass the dried corn through the coarsest setting.,"Adjust the mill plates/stones to the machine's coarsest setting. Place the dried corn into the hopper, then crank the handle to grind it through the machine.Make sure that you have a bowl or other container beneath the grain mill to collect the processed corn. When using an electric grain mill, you'll need to switch on the power instead of turning a handle. The exact method for adjusting the mill plates will vary by machine, so you'll need to consult the instructions for your grain mill to determine the proper procedure. Usually, though, you can adjust the coarseness using a knob on the side of the machine. Note that you should work in batches of about 2 cups (500 ml), which is the approximate amount used in these instructions. When making larger quantities of cornmeal, work inn multiple batches."
1185,Make Cornmeal,7,none,8,Sift the product.,"Dump the coarsely ground corn into a fine-mesh strainer. Gently agitate the strainer from side to side to separate the finely ground pieces from the coarser chunks.Ideally, you should use a mesh strainer with gaps measuring between 1/32 and 1/16 inch (0.8 and 1.5 mm). Larger mesh strainers may pass pieces that are too coarse to be classified as meal. Collect the small pieces that pass through in a separate bowl placed beneath the strainer. Return the larger pieces caught in the strainer to the hopper of the grain mill."
1186,Make Cornmeal,8,none,9,Grind the corn using a finer setting.,"Adjust the mill plates again, setting them to a medium-grade coarseness. Grind the large pieces of cracked corn through the mill as before.   It's important to change the coarseness to a finer setting during this step; otherwise, too few of the larger pieces won't be ground down any further."
1187,Make Cornmeal,9,none,10,Sift the product.,"Transfer the newly ground corn pieces back to the fine mesh strainer. Rock the strainer from side to side, allowing the finest pieces to pass through into the previous collection bowl for your cornmeal.   You'll likely collect more cornmeal during this sifting than you collected during the first, but in most cases, you'll still be left with a notable amount of coarse grain caught in strainer."
1188,Make Cornmeal,10,none,11,Pass the corn through an even finer setting.,"Adjust the grain mill once more, setting the machine to medium-fine consistency. Return the larger pieces of ground corn to the hopper, then grind them through the machine a third time.   While the machine needs to be set to a finer degree of coarseness, you'll probably need to avoid using the finest setting. Even at cornmeal consistency, ground corn can be too coarse to pass through most mills' finest setting."
1189,Make Cornmeal,11,none,12,Separate the remaining meal and grits.,"Sift the ground corn through the mesh strainer one more time, collecting the fine meal in your original bowl and retaining the coarser grits.   At this point, you should have more cornmeal than leftover grits, and the amount of cornmeal should roughly match the original amount of dried corn you began with. If you're still not satisfied with the amount of cornmeal produced, however, you can pass through the coarse grits through your grain mill one more time. Afterward, sift them again using the mesh strainer. The amount of cornmeal produced by a fourth pass will likely be less than the amount produced by the previous two passes. Moreover, beyond a fourth pass, additional passes through the grain mill may become even less beneficial. If you're okay with the amount of leftover grits, however, consider saving them and preparing them as you would prepare store-bought grits."
1192,Make Cornmeal,14,none,15,"Alternatively, vacuum-seal the cornmeal.","This is another way to save leftover cornmeal that should prevent it from turning rancid.   The best way to vacuum-seal cornmeal is with the use of an actual vacuum-sealing machine and the appropriate bags or storage containers. Exact instructions will vary by machine. If you do not have the actual machine, however, you can mimic the process using standard plastic bags.  Place the cornmeal in a heavy-duty resealable plastic bag. Press out as much air as possible, then seal the bag, leaving only 1 inch (2.5 cm) of open space along the seal. Suck out as much of the remaining air through a straw inserted into the opening. Do this step carefully to avoid accidentally inhaling bits of cornmeal. When finished, quickly remove the straw and seal the remainder of the opening.   Vacuum-sealed bags of cornmeal can be stored in dark, dry, slightly cool conditions for up to 9 or 12 months."

1217,Peel Potatoes With an Ordinary Kitchen Knife,15,C,C6,Spear the potato with a two-pronged fork.,Hold the fork with your non-dominant hand. The fork should go directly through the middle of the potato so that you do not have to touch the hot potato with your fingers.
1221,Prepare Food if You Are Lazy,0,none,1,Gather the basics.,"If you have a pulse, most likely you have a loaf of sliced white bread in the house. Ditto for a toaster. If not, these are absolute necessities for any culinary-inclined lazy person, as toast takes almost no time or effort to make and can be the base of a wide variety of meals.;"
1222,Prepare Food if You Are Lazy,1,none,2,Begin to build on the basic meal.,"Spice up your toast with a slice of cheese, as this adds protein and, more importantly, flavor to your budding meal. Toast bread with cheese on top in a toaster oven, or add cheese to bread once you've toasted it. Then top your cheese toast with a little salsa and sliced avocado, and put it all together for a delicious and well-rounded sandwich."
1223,Prepare Food if You Are Lazy,2,none,3,Add an easy side dish.,"Cut up lettuce and tomatoes and top with any salad dressing for a side salad.  If you have cornflakes lying around, crush some up in your hands and throw them on top of the salad for a little crunch. In almost no more time than it took to make yourself a simple sandwich, you've created a much more elaborate two-dish meal, making a better lunch for the lazy but hungry."
1224,Prepare Food if You Are Lazy,3,none,4,Build on the simple dishes you're already making.,"Have you been cooking frozen hamburger patties for dinner every night? With just a little more effort, you can come up with a much better meal. Slice up an onion and throw it in a frying pan with a couple tablespoons of water and cooking oil. Cook uncovered on medium for about 15 minutes until they start to get a little caramelized.  Add your hamburger patties (pre-thawed in the microwave) and cover the pan.  Let the whole thing cook like that for another 15 minutes or so. Throw a handful of shredded cheese on them and allow it to melt before turning off the heat. Tear up some french bread to eat with it on the side. This makes for a much nicer meal than your average hamburger, but takes only a little more time and effort to prepare.   If you've been eating tacos, throw some fresh vegetables in with the meat while cooking, and top with avocados and tomatoes. If you eat a lot of instant macaroni and cheese, embellish with tomatoes, bell peppers, and canned tuna for a much more well-rounded meal. Get creative - you can enhance almost any quick and easy meal to make it a little tastier."
1225,Prepare Food if You Are Lazy,4,none,5,Experiment with different additions to your current meals.,"If you eat a hamburger every day, no need to stop now - but dress it a little differently every time to add more spice and variety into your culinary lifestyle. You can top your burgers with mozzarella and tomato sauce and sprinkle them with oregano or basil for a pizza burger. You can top them with ranch dressing and crush tortilla chips on top for a tex-mex burger. You can skip the cheese and sprinkle soy sauce on top, add a smidge of ginger, and cook up some rice noodles to eat on the side for an Asian version. Be creative and try out as many styles as you can think of."

1238,Cook Bacon in the Microwave,4,A,A5,Drain the bacon.,"Remove the bacon from the plate and place on a paper towel to absorb any excess grease.          Allow it to sit for about 1 minute to cool. Remove the bacon from the paper towels promptly or it will stick, leaving pieces of paper towel on the bacon."
1239,Cook Bacon in the Microwave,5,A,A6,Eat the bacon.,"Bacon cooked this way is crispy and delicious, and it won't have as much fat as pan-fried bacon, so it's actually healthier. Enjoy the crisp bacon with your eggs or pancakes, in a toasted bacon and tomato sandwich, or as a snack."
1241,Cook Bacon in the Microwave,7,B,B2,Hang slices of bacon over the rim of the bowl.,"Place as many slices of bacon as you want around the rim of the bowl. If you don't want the bacon sticking together, keep gaps between the pieces; otherwise, don't worry about it."
1242,Cook Bacon in the Microwave,8,B,B3,Cook the bacon.,"Place the bacon-draped bowl into the microwave. Cook the bacon on the highest setting for about 90 seconds per slice. If you're cooking a full pound of bacon, it may take up to 15 minutes.          To avoid splattering the microwave with grease, you can lightly cover the bacon with a few paper towels. Rotate the microwave plate at 10 minutes. This will ensure even cooking of the bacon. Or, if you don't like your bacon crisp, take it out at this point. Be careful! The plate is hot and the hot grease has dripped onto it. Keep checking the crispness to see if it's to your liking."
1243,Cook Bacon in the Microwave,9,B,B4,Remove the bacon from the microwave.,"You may need to use an oven mitt, as the bowl and plate will be hot. Carefully take it from the microwave and put it down on a heat-safe surface. Use tongs to take the bacon slices off the bowl and lay them out flat on a paper towel.          If you let the bacon slices cool on the bowl, they will form a ""U"" shape for serving. Be very careful not to spill the bacon grease as you remove the plate from the microwave."
1244,Cook Bacon in the Microwave,10,B,B5,Save the grease.,"If you want, the grease can be saved for cooking. Either pour the grease into a storage container straight from the plate, or place it in the fridge (as shown here) and allow it to harden with cooling and scrape off. It makes fried eggs very tasty!          Dispose of the fat if you don't want to use it for cooking. Be very careful handling the bowl and plate, as they're extremely hot."

Slide the turkey-laden tray onto the bottom shelf of the refrigerator. Allow one day of thawing per four to five pounds of turkey. Start defrosting a 20 pound turkey on Saturday to ensure it will be ready to cook Thanksgiving morning. Place the turkey still in its wrapper in the sink and cover with cold water. Change the water every 30 minutes. Allow 30 minutes per pound (a 20 pound Turkey will take 10 hours to thaw). Cook immediately. The USDA also provides the following information on how to defrost a turkey safely.;"
1270,Roast a Turkey,1,none,2,Remove the giblets.,"Stick your hand in the cavity and remove any packages, or liver, heart, neck, and other things you may find inside of the bird. If desired, save everything but the liver for giblet gravy. Fry the giblets or, except for the liver (which has a non-turkey-like flavor that, although pleasant to many, would make the drippings or gravy taste odd), just leave them to roast and eat them. The gizzard and heart are tough, so cut them up––do not give them to a small child who could possibly choke on them."
1271,Roast a Turkey,2,none,3,Rinse off the turkey.,"Hold the turkey under room temperature or cold water and rub it gently with your fingers. Make sure there isn't any dirt, pieces of feathers, etc."
1272,Roast a Turkey,3,none,4,Pat dry.,"Use a cloth or paper towel, pat it dry; don't rub it. Make sure you dry the whole bird, inside and out, as much as you can. If you use a cloth towel, put it straight into the washing machine afterwards."
1273,Roast a Turkey,4,none,5,"Place the turkey in the roasting pan, breast side up.",Try to keep it centered to promote even heating.

1275,Roast a Turkey,6,none,7,Season the turkey.,"Sprinkle oregano, rosemary, garlic powder, and pepper lightly over the top of the turkey. Put some on the inside as well.          Quarter the onion and put it all inside the turkey. Put the three garlic cloves in with the onion. Make sure that both are peeled. After this is done, pour in broth until it is surrounding the turkey (about 1 cup). Insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of a thigh making sure it does not touch the bone. An electronic thermometer with a cord extending to the outside of the oven and an alarm for a particular temperature is particularly convenient. Even with these, leave the pop-up thermometer to help confirm that you are not long overcooking the turkey due to a measurement error."
1276,Roast a Turkey,7,none,8,Preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).,
1277,Roast a Turkey,8,none,9,Roast the turkey.,"When the oven is at temperature, place the turkey in oven (bottom rack) and until meat is 161°F (72°C). Allow about 15 minutes per pound.      If you're using a roasting bag, shake a turkey size oven bag with 1 tablespoon of flour. Place the bag on the roast pan. Slide the turkey breast side up, in the bag. Twist tie shut. Cut slits in the bag. Do not add any broth. Make sure the bag isn't hanging over the edge. If you're not using a roasting bag, put about a quarter-inch of water in the pan and cover the pan with its lid or some foil. Basically the turkey should steam for most of the cooking time. Check on the turkey every hour or so and replenish the watery liquid if it is almost all gone."
1278,Roast a Turkey,9,none,10,Make it golden.,"Uncover the turkey and turn your oven to Broil for ten minutes. Make sure to keep a close watch on it during this time as ovens vary and broil is usually a very high temperature. If you are using a roasting bag, open the top completely before broiling.          Start this process when the turkey is still a few degrees from done temperature, because it will continue to heat. You may wish to remove a meat thermometer, especially a more expensive and probably more fragile electronic one, so the intense radiant heat does not destroy it. In that case, err on the side of potentially warming the turkey a few degrees more than you expected, to make sure it's safe."
1279,Roast a Turkey,10,none,11,Let it rest.,Remove the turkey from the juices and place on a cutting board. Remove any stuffing. Loosely cover with tinfoil and wait 20 minutes before slicing to prevent the turkey from losing all of its juices. Use this time to make gravy.

1287,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,0,none,1,Cut the fish into strips.,"Make sure to cut off any skin that may be on the fish first. Once this is done, begin to slice the fish into thin, even strips. A simple way to make finger-sized sticks is to cut the fish into strips about one inch (2.5 cm) wide then cut across them to make them about three inches (7.6 cm) wide.White fish, including cod, halibut, and tilapia, are commonly used for fish sticks and are available, healthy options.;"

Start by filling the first bowl with ½ cup (120 mL) all-purpose or whole wheat flour.While some fish sticks are made without flour, the flour helps the breading stick."
1289,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,2,none,3,Set up an egg-coating station.,"In your second bowl, crack open two eggs. Add a tablespoon of lemon juice, then stir the mixture with a whisk or spoon until the eggs are beaten."
1290,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,3,none,4,Combine seasonings into a breading station.,"Retrieve the third fresh bowl. Add ½ cup (120 mL) dried breadcrumbs, ¼ cup (60 mL) grated parmesan cheese, ½ teaspoon salt, ½ teaspoon paprika, and ¼ teaspoon black pepper. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon or other implement.Change the breading ingredients to achieve your personal taste. For example, you can remove the cheese, substitute in lemon-pepper seasoning, or use a packaged seafood seasoning."
1291,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,4,none,5,Butter a cooking sheet.,"Before you begin working with the fish, prepare a tray to contain the breaded pieces. Use a stick of butter or butter-flavored cooking spray to lubricate the pan so the fish doesn’t stick. Coat generously.If you want to avoid butter, try spraying a little olive oil cooking spray on the breaded fish. With a spray, you control how much oil you use and won’t add much fat to the recipe."
1292,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,5,none,6,Place a fish strip in the flour bowl.,"Take one strip only. Put it in the bowl, then roll it around so that all the sides are evenly coated with flour."
1293,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,6,none,7,Dip the fish strip in the egg bowl.,"Once the piece of fish is coated with flour, move it to the egg bowl and repeat the process. Place it in the bowl and roll it around until the entire piece is coated with the egg mixture."
1294,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,7,none,8,Coat the fish strip in the breadcrumb bowl.,"Move the floured, egged strip to the bowl containing the breading ingredients. Like with the other stations, press the fish into the breading. Move it around until all sides are coated."
1295,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,8,none,9,Place the fish on the pan.,"Lubricate the pan with butter or cooking spray if you haven’t yet. Lay the coated stick on the pan, then repeat the above steps with more of your fish strips. Move the finished ones to the pan, laying them so they don’t touch."
1296,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,9,none,10,Preheat your oven.,"Set your oven to a temperature between 400 and 450 degrees F (204-232 degrees C). Depending on the strength of your oven and the size of your fish sticks, cooking time will vary."
1297,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,10,none,11,Bake for 10-15 minutes.,"Leave the tray to sit in the oven for 10-15 minutes. The longer you leave the sticks in, the more golden and solidified the breading will be. When the fish is opaque, flaky, and cooked through, it is done cooking.   You can also fry the fish in oil on a stovetop, but the oil makes it less healthy than baking."
1298,Make Healthier Fish Sticks,11,none,12,Serve your fish sticks.,"Once the fish looks cooked and the breading browned to your preference, the sticks are ready to eat. They can be dipped in a ketchup, tartar sauce, or a homemade sauce. Leftover sticks can be sealed in foil or a plastic bag and stored for up to four days."
1299,Air Dry Fruit,0,none,1,Wash and peel the fruit.,Core or remove pits if applicable.;
1300,Air Dry Fruit,1,none,2,Slice the fruit thinly.,"Keep slices equally sized, so all the pieces will dry in the same amount of time.   Trim apples into rings or slices about 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) wide. Cut bananas into portions about 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) to 3/8 inch (1 cm) wide. Cut apricots in half or slice them. Cut pears, peaches, and nectarines into slices or quarters. Slice pineapple into pieces 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide."
1301,Air Dry Fruit,2,none,3,Pre-treat the fruit with ascorbic acid to prevent discoloration.,"You don't have to pre-treat pineapple.   Buy ascorbic acid powder where you find canning supplies or at health food stores, where it may be labeled Vitamin C powder. Blend 1 teaspoon (3000 mg) ascorbic acid with 2 cups (475 ml) water. You can use the mixture 2 times before you need to add more ascorbic acid. Soak the fruit pieces for 3 to 5 minutes, then drain thoroughly on paper towels."
1302,Air Dry Fruit,3,none,4,"Check the local weather forecast for a hot, dry spell.",You must have several consecutive days with at least 86 degrees Fahrenheit (30 Celsius). Humidity should be less than 60 percent.
1303,Air Dry Fruit,4,none,5,Get a screen or wood tray for a drying rack.,"Choose a screen made from plastic, stainless steel, or fiberglass coated with Teflon. These types can be safely used for fruit. Reject screens that can leave harmful deposits on food or alter food's nutritional value. Don't use screens constructed with aluminum, copper, or metal cloth covered with zinc or cadmium. Avoid wood trays made with cedar, green wood, oak, pine, or redwood. These will taint the flavor or discolor the fruit."
1304,Air Dry Fruit,5,none,6,Choose a drying site in full sun where you can keep an eye on the fruit.,"Place metal sheeting on the ground. Aluminum or tin will reflect sunshine and raise the drying temperature. Select a concrete surface if metal sheeting is unavailable. A concrete patio without a roof or a paved driveway will suffice. A concrete surface is drier than soil, which will allow the fruit to dry more quickly."
1305,Air Dry Fruit,6,none,7,Make 2 stacks of cinder blocks or bricks.,
1306,Air Dry Fruit,7,none,8,Set the drying rack onto the blocks or bricks.,This will allow air to circulate around the fruit.

1311,Air Dry Fruit,12,none,13,"Air dry the fruit for 2 to 6 days, until only about 20 percent of the moisture remains.",
1312,Air Dry Fruit,13,none,14,Check the fruit for sufficient dryness.,Slice some of the fruit pieces in half. You should not see any moisture nor be able to squeeze out any moisture. Bend the fruit. It should not adhere to itself or be sticky.
1313,Air Dry Fruit,14,none,15,Pasteurize the dehydrated fruit in your freezer.,This is necessary to kill any bacteria that might make you will when you eat the fruit.   Place the dried fruit in a plastic freezer bag. Make sure the freezer temperature is at 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 Celsius) or colder. Keep the bag in the freezer for a minimum of 48 hours.
1314,Air Dry Fruit,15,none,16,Transfer the fruit to a storage container after pasteurization.,"Select glass containers with tight lids, freezer bags, or freezer containers.   Keep the containers somewhere cool, dim, and dry. Dried fruit will keep for up to a year at 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 Celsius)."
1315,Make a Hearty Stew,0,A,A1,"Cut your beef chuck into small, 1-inch cubes.","Although your beef cubes don't all need to have the same uniformity, it helps to try to be consistent. When cutting the beef chuck, remove any excess fat dangling from the outside of the cubes of meat.          What if you don't have beef chuck? Rump, bottom round, or topside cuts will all do. What you want to avoid is getting pre-cut beef ""for stewing"" at the grocery store or market.You'll end up paying more and getting a lower quality meat.;"
1316,Make a Hearty Stew,1,A,A2,Coat your beef in the all-purpose flour.,"In batches, transfer the beef cubes into a medium bowl containing the flour. Work the beef cubes into the flour so that each cube has a thin layer of flour coating its outside. This will give the beef a nice nutty flavor and great texture. It will also help establish a tasty ""fond"" on the bottom of your cooking pot.         A fond is a sticky dark glaze that coats the bottom of the pan. It contributes to the rich, caramelized flavor that separates a merely good stew from a great one."
1317,Make a Hearty Stew,2,A,A3,"In a large Dutch oven or soup pot, begin searing the beef cubes over medium-high heat.","First add 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil and the butter. Then, sear the beef in batches. Leave the beef on one side for 3 to 5 minutes, until it has developed great color and easily comes off the pan. Move it over to its side and brown on all sides.          When a batch is done, remove beef with a slotted spoon and add the next batch. Continue cooking in the same manner as directed above, until all beef has been adequately browned.  Do not clean the bowl after cooking the beef. You'll notice that your fond has started to develop. This fond will give your dish more of a full flavor, so don't make the mistake of removing it."
1318,Make a Hearty Stew,3,B,B1,"After removing beef from pot, start to cook the onions and celery over medium heat.","Add the remaining teaspoon of vegetable oil and begin cooking the onions and celery over the fond created by the beef. Cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until onions are soft and translucent, not browned."
1319,Make a Hearty Stew,4,B,B2,Add the garlic and cook for about 30 seconds.,Stir frequently during this time.
1320,Make a Hearty Stew,5,B,B3,"Add the tomato paste, a pinch of salt, and one tablespoon of the Worcestershire sauce to the onions and celery.","Cook, stirring frequently, for 1 to 2 minutes, or until all tomato paste has been incorporated."
1321,Make a Hearty Stew,6,B,B4,Deglaze the pan with 1 cup of red wine.,"Turn the heat back to medium-high and add the red wine. The wine should start steaming and bubbling up immediately. With a wooden spoon, scrape the bottom of the pan, breaking up the fond. Continue scraping and stirring until the wine has reduced somewhat."
1322,Make a Hearty Stew,7,B,B5,Add the meat and stock to the pan.,
1323,Make a Hearty Stew,8,B,B6,"Make a bouquet garni with the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaf, adding it into the stew.","A bouquet garni is a simple way to hold your herbs and spices in one place, making removal simple after the stew is cooked. Simply put the herbs in cheesecloth and tie one end together with a length of string. Submerge the herb-end of the bouquet into the stew and tie the string to one of the pot's handles to make retrieval easy."
1324,Make a Hearty Stew,9,C,C1,"Cover your pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer for 1 and 1/2 hours.","Make sure the stew is simmering, not boiling. Stir the stew every so often."
1325,Make a Hearty Stew,10,C,C2,Add the potatoes and carrots to the stew.,"Cover and cook for 40 to 60 minutes, stirring every so often. Carrots and potatoes are finished when a fork can easily puncture them."
1326,Make a Hearty Stew,11,C,C3,"Add the peas, Worcestershire, and a tiny bit of red wine to finish off the stew.",Untie the bouquet garni and remove it from the pot. Taste and add any needed salt and pepper.

1336,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,0,A,A1,Preheat your oven to 475ºF (246ºC).,"This recipe uses a high baking temperature to cut down on cooking time. While you wait for your oven to heat up, you can proceed to the next few steps to save even more time.;"
1337,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,1,A,A2,"Optionally, prepare a baking sheet.","This recipe does not call for baking sheet that's been greased or made ""non-stick"" in any way. However, if you wish to grease your baking sheet with shortening or a non-stick spray, this won't hurt the biscuits. This may be a good idea if you have had problems with baked goods sticking to the pan in the past.   Other alternatives include using a sheet of baking parchment or sprinkling a layer of flour over the baking sheet."
1338,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,2,A,A3,Combine the dry ingredients.,"Add the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a large bowl. Whisk together until well-blended."
1339,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,3,A,A4,Add wet ingredients.,"Measure the oil and pour it into a separate bowl or container. Next, measure the milk and pour it on top of the oil. Do not stir or combine these ingredients. Pour them together into the bowl containing the dry ingredients."
1340,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,4,A,A5,Mix the ingredients to form a dough.,"Use a mixing utensil or your hands to lightly combine the wet and dry ingredients. Transfer the dough to a floured surface (countertops work well) and knead once or twice to form a ball of dough.   You don't want to mix too much or the biscuits can lose their light, flaky texture. Be sure to stop mixing when the dry ingredients are almost uniformly moist and sticky — a few tiny clumps that aren't combined are OK. Be sure also to knead only once or twice."
1341,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,5,A,A6,Roll out the dough.,"You have a little freedom here depending on how thick you like your biscuits. On the same floured surface where you kneaded the dough, roll it out to about 1/2 to 3/4-inch thick. You can use either a roller or your hands as long as you get the dough uniformly flat.   To cut down on mess, you can put the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap before rolling it if you wish."
1342,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,6,A,A7,Cut out two-inch biscuits.,"Use a round cookie cutter to cut circles of dough two inches in diameter from the flattened dough. Dust the biscuit cutter in flour first to prevent sticking. Transfer the cut-out biscuits to your baking pan, leaving at least an inch of space between each so they cook evenly.   When you've cut out all the biscuits you can from the dough, roll the leftovers into a ball and flatten it again, then repeat."
1343,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,7,A,A8,Bake the biscuits until lightly browned.,"This will typically take about 10-12 minutes. However, since you're using high heat, it's wise to check on the biscuits after about eight minutes just to be safe.   After carefully removing the baking pan from the oven, let the biscuits sit for about five minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature."
1346,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,10,B,B3,Mix the ingredients.,"There are only two ingredients in this recipe — the mix and the milk. Pour the mix into a large bowl, then add the milk. Stir lightly to combine. Stop stirring as soon as the dough reaches a uniformly sticky, flaky consistency.   Note that some biscuit mixes may call for you to add oil or butter as well. Check the directions to be safe."
1347,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,11,B,B4,Knead the dough.,"Turn the sticky dough onto a floured baking surface (you can use the biscuit mix itself as well). Use your hands to turn the dough over on itself 10 times. Kneading more can cause the biscuits to lose their light, flaky qualities."
1348,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,12,B,B5,Roll the dough out.,"From this point on, the directions are almost the same as for the recipe above. Use a roller or your hands to roll the dough ball into a 1/2-inch thick layer. If you wish, you can roll the dough between two sheets of plastic wrap to prevent a mess."
1349,Make Easy Homemade Biscuits,13,B,B6,Cut out biscuits.,"Use a 2-inch cookie cutter to cut circular biscuits from the flattened dough. Transfer each circle of dough to your baking pan. Re-combine the leftover dough into another ball, roll it flat, and repeat."

1366,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,0,A,A1,Steam the cauliflower and preheat the oven.,Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Wash 1 head of cauliflower and discard any leaves. Chop the cauliflower into chunks while you heat a sauce pot with a little water in it. Set the cauliflower inside a steamer basket and place it in the pot. Cover the pot and steam the cauliflower until it's very soft.It should take 10 to 12 minutes for the cauliflower to become tender.;
1367,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,1,A,A2,Mash the cauliflower and garlic.,"Place the steamed cauliflower into a food processor along with 3 cloves of minced garlic. Put the lid on the processor and blitz it a few times, so the cauliflower is pureed. The mixture should be completely smooth.The softer your cauliflower is, the smoother it will be once you puree it. This is why it's important to steam it until it's completely tender."
1368,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,2,A,A3,"Combine the mashed cauliflower with the yogurt, cheese, and whole eggs.",Get out a large mixing bowl and scoop the pureed cauliflower mixture into it. Stir in more of the biscuit dough ingredients with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until the mixture is completely combined. You'll need to mix in:1/3 cup (95 g) of nonfat Greek yogurt 1/2 cup (50 g) of shredded cheddar cheese 2 eggs 1 teaspoon of kosher salt 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper
1369,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,3,A,A4,Beat the egg whites and fold them into the cauliflower biscuit dough.,"Get out another mixing bowl and place 2 egg whites in it. Use an electric or stand mixer to beat the egg whites on high speed. Beat the egg whites for a few minutes, so they become stiff. Gently fold the egg whites into the cauliflower mixture.To fold the egg whites, hold a spatula and carefully use a twisting motion with your wrist to combine the cauliflower mixture with the lighter egg whites. The goal is to maintain the volume of the egg whites."
1370,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,4,A,A5,Fill a mini-muffin tin and bake the cauliflower biscuits.,"Spray a mini-muffin tin with cooking spray, to prevent sticking. Fill the cups with the cauliflower biscuit dough, so the dough comes to the top of each cup. Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes. They should brown and look a little crisp around the edges. Let the biscuits cool on a rack until they're cool enough to handle and serve.Consider using a small cookie scoop to fill the muffin cups. You could also just use a few small spoons to scoop the dough."
1372,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,6,B,B2,"Saute the cauliflower, jalapeno, bacon, and spices.","Pour 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of extra virgin olive oil into a large skillet. Heat the oil over medium and add the shredded cauliflower. Chop 1 jalapeno and add it to the skillet along with 1/3 cup (50 g) of chopped, cooked bacon. Saute the mixture for about 7 minutes, so the cauliflower softens a little and looks a little clear. Season the mixture with:1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt 1/2 teaspoon of black pepper"
1373,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,7,B,B3,Remove the mixture from heat and stir in the binding ingredients.,"Turn off the heat and transfer the sauteed mixture to a mixing bowl. Crack 2 eggs into the bowl and add 1/2 cup (48 g) of almond flour. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to mix the ingredients until they're completely combined.Since there's no gluten in the dough, don't worry about over mixing it."
1374,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,8,B,B4,Form the cauliflower biscuits.,"Lay a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. Use a 1/4 cup measuring cup to scoop out a portion of biscuit dough onto the parchment paper. It should come out easily in a circular shape, although you may need to tap down hard to get the dough to fall out. Continue portioning out the dough into biscuits. You should end up with about 12 biscuits on the sheet.If the dough is sticking to the cup, you can dip the cup in some almond flour."
1375,Cook Cauliflower Biscuits,9,B,B5,Bake the cauliflower biscuits.,Put the sheet of biscuits in the preheated oven and bake them for 35 to 40 minutes. They should turn golden brown and crispy around the edges. Remove the baking sheet once they've finished baking. Let them rest on the sheet for 5 minutes before you remove them to a cooling rack.Use oven mitts when handling the hot baking sheet. You can store leftover biscuits in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
1376,Make Cake Balls,0,none,1,Grab your favorite cake mix.,"The great thing about cake balls is that you can create them out of any of your standard favorites: chocolate, vanilla, red velvet, whatever! Between the cake mix, frosting, and decorations you can use for your cake balls, your options are pretty endless.   Make sure to pick up all of the ingredients listed on the cake mix (typically oil and eggs).;"
1377,Make Cake Balls,1,none,2,Follow the instructions on the box.,"You don’t need to do anything special– just prepare the cake as directed. You can use any pan, just make sure you’re following the directions for that pan size. Pop your cake into the oven for the directed amount of time. If they list a baking time range, opt for the lower end– soft cake works best for cake balls."
1378,Make Cake Balls,2,none,3,Remove your cake from the oven.,"Check to see that it’s cooked thoroughly by sticking a toothpick into the middle of it. If the toothpick slides out relatively clean, the cake is done. If the toothpick comes out with batter on it, you’ll need to stick your cake in the oven for a few more minutes. Just make sure you check it regularly so it doesn’t burn."
1379,Make Cake Balls,3,none,4,Crumble the cake into a large bowl.,"It’s best to do this while the cake is still warm. Cut chunks of cake at a time and crumble them into the mixing bowl. You can use your hands, or you can use a mixer to break it up more quickly. Continue until the entire cake is crumbled into the bowl."
1380,Make Cake Balls,4,none,5,Stir in the frosting.,"Scoop the frosting into the bowl of crumbled cake, and continuously stir.Depending on the size of your cake mix box, the amount of frosting you’ll need will vary. Most cake mixes are 15.25 ounces, but there are also mixes that come in 18.2 ounces and bigger. For a 15.25 box of cake mix, you'll need about 3/4 cup of frosting. Add a bit more for a bigger box. Keep adding frosting until the mixture is a malleable texture, like Play-Doh, and you can form it without it crumbling."
1382,Make Cake Balls,6,none,7,Roll the mixture into balls with your hands.,"The optimal size for a cake ball is about the size of a Ping-Pong ball. Grab a chunk of dough and roll it between your palms. Once it’s as smooth and round as you can make it, place it on a tray lined with wax paper."
1383,Make Cake Balls,7,none,8,Place the tray in the fridge.,"You don’t need to keep it in there very long. Fifteen to twenty minutes will allow the balls to firm up, and they’ll be easier to coat and decorate.If you’re crunched for time, put them in the freezer for about five minutes.   The cake balls are done with the outside no longer feels moist and you can squeeze them gently without them losing their shape."
1384,Make Cake Balls,8,none,9,Melt your coating in a small pan.,"You can use white chocolate, milk chocolate, or dark chocolate– whatever you’re in the mood for. Make sure to purchase the chocolate specifically meant for melting and baking. Set your stove to low heat, stirring constantly, so that you don’t burn your chocolate. Once it is completely melted, turn off the heat."
1385,Make Cake Balls,9,none,10,Dip your cake balls into the melted chocolate.,"This step can be tricky, but there are a few different ways to do this. Try sticking a toothpick into the cake ball and use it to dip the ball into the chocolate, turning it in the pan so that the entire ball is evenly coated. Once you’ve let the excess chocolate drip off the cake ball, place it back on the wax paper.   You can also place the cake ball in the batter with a spoon or even with your hand, but you may have difficulty getting the chocolate perfectly smoothed around the cake ball."
1386,Make Cake Balls,10,none,11,Decorate your cake ball.,"While the chocolate is still warm, you can add some extra goodies, if you want. Scatter colorful sprinkles over the balls, or coat them with edible glitter. To make your cake balls extra decadent, you can even sprinkle them with crushed Oreos, Reese’s, or M&M’s. You can drizzle your cake balls with caramel or another liquid topping as well.          If you’re making several different kinds of cake balls, it can be helpful to use your decorations to signify what flavor of cake is in the inside. For example, red velvet cake balls could be decorated with crushed Oreos while vanilla cake balls could be decorated with sprinkles."

1434,Make Corn Fritters,14,B,B5,Drop spoonfuls of the batter into the oil.,"You can use a cookie scooper or a regular spoon to scoop out each spoonful of dough.

1438,Broil Steak,0,none,1,Select your steak.,"At the grocery store or butcher's shop, choose a steak that is well-marbled (meaning there are several thin veins of fat running through the meat) and is a rich, red color (raw beef that is a brownish color is beginning to get old or has freezer burn).         Broiling will work best on medium-thickness cuts, so choose a steak that is less than an inch and a quarter thick. If your steak is too thick, the outside will burn before the inside warms through enough. A good, inexpensive cut that will still give you tender, juicy steak (especially if marinated) is a flank steak. If you don't see any in the display case at the grocery store, feel free to ask the butcher if he has any in the back. Top sirloins will also give you great results if you're willing to spend a little more, and are easier to find at discount grocers like Walmart.;"
1439,Broil Steak,1,none,2,Prepare your steak for cooking.,"The way you prepare your steak depends on the type of cut you have selected, as well as your personal preference. You could simply season your steak with salt, pepper, or go heavy on the flavors with a rich marinade.          If your steak is a very high quality cut of beef (e.g., a tenderloin (fillet) or New York steak), a rub with coarse salt and pepper is all you need. The steak will have its own amazing flavor that won’t need the help of other seasonings. However, if seasoning is your thing, try add a dash of garlic or a hint of rosemary. For tougher cuts, such as a round or flank steak, a marinade can help make it more flavorful and tender. Soak the beef for an hour or more in a sauce that contains a combination of acids (e.g., vinegar) and salt(or soy sauce). This will help break down the tough meat fibers and will infuse the steak with flavor. Place the steak in a shallow dish or bowl, cover it in the marinade, and cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap. If you choose to marinate your steak,you should do so in the fridge (40°F (4.5°C) or below) to prevent foodborne illness if you are marinating for more than 30 minutes. Let the steak rest on the counter for 20 to 30 minutes to get to room temperature just before cooking for best results."
1440,Broil Steak,2,none,3,Prepare your oven and pan.,"Once your steak is ready to cook, set it aside. Adjust your oven rack so that the top of the steak will be about 4 inches (10cm) from the broiler heating element. Then turn the oven on to ""broil"" and preheat at 350f.          If you don’t know where your broiler is, check both the bottom and the top of your oven. Most electric ovens have a broiler in their ‘ceiling’ but some older gas models have separate units under the main part of the stove that acts as their broiler.If you like your steak cooked past medium, a good trick is to let the steak come to room temp, then stick it in the freezer while the oven preheats. The 5-10 min in the freezer before hitting the oven allows the outside of the steak to cook a little slower, allowing you to cook the interior to well without overcooking the exterior of the steak."
1441,Broil Steak,3,none,4,Lightly grease your broiler pan with cooking spray.,"Broiler pans look like a cookie sheet, with an inset 'grill' top put on them that has slots on it for juices to drip down below to the cookie sheet. Place your steak on the broiler pan, allowing the excess marinade to drain. Do not use Pyrex or glass cookware for broiling. They cannot handle the high heat and will break.         Note that a broiler pan is best for broiling foods, but that you can also use a shallow baking dish (lined with foil for easier cleanup) or cast-iron pan if you don't have one. The downside to using a non-draining surface is that the fats that excrete off of your steak as it cooks will pool around its edges and possibly cause it to burn. To avoid this, try moving the steak to a different area of the pan with less fat as it cooks. Be careful--that grease is hot!"
1442,Broil Steak,4,none,5,Broil your steak.,"Place your steak into the oven on the rack closest to the broiler. Cooking times will vary greatly based on the cut of steak, cooking altitude, type of oven you're using, and how hot the broiler runs; cooking times can range from 3 to 18 minutes. A good rule of thumb to go by is to watch it! If it looks ""done"" on one side, flip it over with tongs. Remember to always use oven mitts when reaching into the oven.          In general, the most common cooking time is four minutes on one side, and then four minutes on the other. Of course, as each cut of steak is different, it is always best to simply determine the cooking time for yourself."
1443,Broil Steak,5,none,6,Determine whether or not your steak is done.,"There are several tests you can do to figure out how ""done"" a steak is. Of course, your definition of ‘done’ might be barely cooked (ie. very rare.) while someone else’s definition might be cooked until it is bone dry. The easiest way to tell who done a steak is to cut into the thickest part of the steak and check the color. A rare steak will still be blood red and have red juices; a medium steak will be pink and have almost clear juices; a well-done steak will be brownish gray and have brown juices. Other methods include:          Check the edges. If you have a thicker steak, the color of the edges is often a good way to tell how done the middle is. When the edges change from red to pink to brown, the inside is probably moving from rare to medium rare to medium. Test the ""fleshiness."" Pinch the flesh stretching between your thumb and forefinger--the muscled part, not just the skin--with your other thumb and forefinger. Can you feel how it's firm, but supple? How it gives under pressure, but bounces back? That's the way the middle of a medium-cooked steak feels. To test for this, prod the steak with your tongs or the flat edge of a knife (don't pierce it with a fork). Test to see if it ""wiggles"" or not. If it still feels too fleshy, give it another minute or two.Listen to it. When the outside of a steak goes from cooked to overcooked, the sound of the sizzling will become louder and sharper."
1444,Broil Steak,6,none,7,Remove your steak from the oven and let it rest.,"Remove the broiler pan from the oven and test the steak once more for doneness. If it's cooked to your liking, don't be tempted to cut it up immediately! Letting a piece of meat ""rest"" for a few minutes before slicing it is the number one way to make sure it stays juicy. Wait until most of the steam from the steak has slowed and the juices stop running off--usually around 4 or 5 minutes--before digging in.          Of course, some people simply can’t wait--which is fine too! Digging in immediately won’t ruin the steak--but it may burn your mouth! Use caution."

1470,Make Coq au Vin,4,none,5,Cook the Mushrooms.,"After this time, heat up a new pan with 1 tablespoon of the reserved fat.

For more flavour, add some chopped red shallots to the mushrooms."
1471,Make Coq au Vin,5,none,6,Make a beurre manié with the flour.,"Ideally use 1 tablespoon of the remaining chicken and bacon fat if available or use butter. Cream the two together to a paste and stir into the chicken. Simmer 10 minutes more or until thickened and there is no floury texture. You may also use cornflour which cooks out much quicker, but does add a different texture to the sauce.   Some purists will not add any thickening agent other than cockerel or chicken blood (which is both hard to get and expensive), so if you do not wish to use any thickening agent, transfer some of the sauce to another pan and boil briskly until reduced, then add back to the chicken. This can however make the end result more stronger tasting and salty."

1568,Make Jambalaya,0,none,1,Pre-cut the meat into bite-sized chunks and peel and devein any shrimp.,"Jambalaya takes a ton of ingredients, puts them in the same big pot, and lets the flavors meld and blend into something amazing. To pull it off, however, takes good kitchen timing and pre-planning. Instead of rushing to chop things and add them as they cook, get in the habit of preparing the big things ahead of time. Jambalaya can use any combination of meats you like, as long as they are pre-cut:    Chicken should be cut in slightly large than bite-size pieces  Sausage should be cut into round discs, roughly 1/4-1/2 inch thick.  Smoked ham should be cut into bite-sized cubes.  Shrimp should be thawed, peeled, and deveined.;"
1569,Make Jambalaya,1,none,2,"Chop the yellow onion, 2-3 stalks of celery, and green pepper into small cubes.","Onions, celery, and green pepper form the ""Holy Trinity"" of Cajun food, and these three aromatic ingredients are at the base of almost every Cajun dish. While you can adjust the ratios however you see fit, most Cajun cooks end up with roughly two parts onion and one part celery and bell pepper. Chop them into pieces no bigger than a half inch.The Holy Trinity can be adjusted to taste, usually adding more onion instead of celery or pepper. More onions usually lead to a richer dish. In a pinch, shallots can be substituted for onions and red and yellow peppers for green. This usually leads to a slightly sweeter Jambalaya."
1570,Make Jambalaya,2,none,3,Heat up 2 tablespoons of oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.,"Make sure you have a nice large sauce pot, preferably with a thick-bottom.You don't want the oil to start smoking, just shimmering lightly, as if a quiet lake is being disturbed by a light breeze."
1571,Make Jambalaya,3,none,4,"Add the chopped vegetables, a quick pinch (1/2 teaspoon) of salt, and stir well.","Salt should be added in small doses while you cook, as it helps unlock the natural flavors of your ingredients as you're cooking.   You want these vegetables to cook until the onions are slightly see through, or ""translucent."" That said, you should move to the next step while they heat up to stay on time."
1572,Make Jambalaya,4,none,5,Mince any desired jalapenos and garlic and add to your Holy Trinity.,"Now that your base is completed, you can start making it your own. Chop up 1-2 jalapeno peppers and 3-5 cloves of garlic, depending on taste. Cut them up about half as large as the vegetables above, and toss them into the hot oil to cook for 1-2 minutes.   Try to time your additions so that the onions, peppers, and celery finish cooking (remember -- translucent) at the same time as the finely chopped garlic and peppers. The seeds of jalapenos are the hottest part, so you can scrape a few of them out if you're worried about it being too hot."
1573,Make Jambalaya,5,none,6,"Toss the meat in (EXCEPT the shrimp), add a pinch of salt, and stir.","Toss in everything but the prawns and let them cook until they are almost finished. Use the chicken as your marker, as it takes longer than the rest and it is easiest to see when it is finished cooking (no more pink flesh). This should take roughly 5-7 minutes, depending on how small you cut the meat.If you have raw, unsmoked sausage, you might consider partially cooking it first. When it is still a little pink, remove it and cook the Holy Trinity in the remaining sausage fat, then add the meat back in with the chicken. If things are sticking, add an extra 1/2 tablespoon of oil, let it heat for 10 seconds or so, then add in the meat."
1574,Make Jambalaya,6,none,7,Heat up your 3-4 cups of broth or stock while the meats finish cooking.,"You can add it cold, but this literally halts the cooking process until the pot can get back up to heat. It is best to preheat your broth first."
1575,Make Jambalaya,7,none,8,"Add the stock, can of crushed tomatoes, and stir until the liquid is simmering.","A simmer is when the bubbles are constantly breaking the surface of the liquid. If you preheated the stock, this should happen quickly. Use your wooden spoon to scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom when the liquid hits -- these give the jambalaya it's appealingly dark, rich color."
1576,Make Jambalaya,8,none,9,"Lower the heat to medium-low and add your spices, stirring well.","This is where you really can make the jambalaya your own, customizing it to your taste buds and preferences. The following spices can all be mixed and matched in any quantities you want, but the basics illustrated here are a good place to start. If you're really lost, try purchasing a Cajun or Creole spice blend from your local supermarket instead:   1/2 teaspoon black, white, red, and/or cayenne pepper (heavier on the cayenne) 1 bay leaf 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika 1 teaspoon thyme and/or Oregano 1/2 teaspoon cracked red pepper flakes A pinch more salt 1/2 teaspoon garlic and/or onion powder"
1577,Make Jambalaya,9,none,10,"Add the rice, cover the pot, and simmer for a half hour, stirring occasionally.","Check the rice starting at 20-25 minutes, stirring every few minutes to prevent the rice on the bottom from burning. As it cooks, the rice should absorb all of the liquid, leaving you with a big, creamy, and flavorful rice dish. If the rice isn't cooked completely and the water is all gone, add another 1/2 cup or so to finish cooking.   Try not to remove the lid for long, as this releases the steam needed to cook the rice. Give it a quick stir every 3-4 minutes and then get the lid right back on."
1578,Make Jambalaya,10,none,11,"Add the shrimp once the rice is almost done, covering the pot again to cook the prawns.","As the rice is getting done, stir in the shrimp and let them cook until they are pink throughout and completely cooked. Use this time to test the spices as well, adding a dash of salt and some seasoning if you desire it."
1579,Make Jambalaya,11,none,12,"Garnish with hot sauce, green onions, and/or parsley and serve hot.","Most Cajun dishes will come with all three options on the table. Some people even love a bright, acidic punch of a lemon slice. Of course, this is all up to your personal preference, but know that these ingredients will certainly up the ""authentic"" factor of your dish."

1608,Make a Cheese Soufflé,4,none,5,Preheat your oven to 200C / 395F.,"Remove all top racks and have the rack at the lower part of the oven. Look at your soufflé dish and estimate its height twice over - the soufflé may rise this much so will need this much room in the oven. It is preferable to cook the soufflé without the oven fan on as the fan can make the soufflé rise unevenly, overcook one side or even push the semi-cooked light batter over the side of the dish. If you have an oven thermometer, use that to ensure your oven is heating to the right temperature. If you serve the soufflé and it is undercooked and very runny in the middle, simply scoop out the cooked portions and serve those. Just like cakes, soufflés unfortunately don't rise again if you put them back in the oven to cook a little more."

1616,Make a Cheese Soufflé,12,none,13,Place into the oven.,"Bake for 15-20 minutes until well risen and golden. Only open the oven door when you are ready to serve to prevent them sinking. If you prepared them in individual ramekins, it is 8-10 minutes as a rule. Ideally the soufflé will have a tender, semi-molten centre and with practice you can refine your skills to recognise when the soufflé has reached this stage. If it is too runny, it is a sign your oven is not efficient at retaining heat, or it may have an inaccurate thermostat."
1617,Make a Cheese Soufflé,13,none,14,"Before you serve them, gather the diners as these really will not wait.","If the kitchen is not on the same floor as the dining room, it may be best to gather guests in the kitchen. Serve immediately with a crisp salad, bread or as is. A good trick is to serve the soufflé dish on a heated serving plate, or at minimum a cork or silicon mat to prevent them cooling (and sinking) quickly. Scoop each portion out onto the plate using a sharp knife and a spoon, or allow guests to eat directly from their own ramekin."

1664,Make Crawfish Etouffe,0,none,1,Chop your vegetables.,"Use equal amounts of celery, onion and green bell peppers (1/2 to 1 cup each) add a couple cloves of chopped garlic. Set aside.;"
1665,Make Crawfish Etouffe,1,none,2,Make your roux.,"This step is found in many Cajun recipes, and it involves browning the flour that is the thickening ingredient for the ""gravy"" the Crawfish are cooked in. Place equal amounts of cooking oil and all purpose flour in a large cast iron skillet over medium heat (1/2 cup is about right for this dish). Stir continuously until the flour is browned, keeping it from overcooking or scorching. The color of the roux is very important. A good Etouffee roux should be the color of shelled pecans."
1666,Make Crawfish Etouffe,2,none,3,"Once the roux has achieved the color you desire, immediately remove from heat and add the chopped vegetables, stir until the vegetables are soft.",This is very important to stop the roux from continuing to cook and burning.
1667,Make Crawfish Etouffe,3,none,4,Add 3/4 cup chicken broth or similar stock and bring to simmering boil in skillet.,
1668,Make Crawfish Etouffe,4,none,5,"Add enough of your roux you prepared earlier to achieve the consistency you desire, saving the rest in a glass jar for your next Cajun cooking adventure.","Simmer until the roux is completely dissolved and the liquid in the pot is thickened. It should be the consistency of a regular gravy, without lumps and uniform in color and texture. Add salt and pepper to taste. The best flavor is achieved by mixing red, white and black pepper in quantities to suit your own taste."
1669,Make Crawfish Etouffe,5,none,6,"Add one pound of cleaned, or packaged Crawfish tails, simmer for 10-15 minutes.",
1670,Make Crawfish Etouffe,6,none,7,"Remove from heat, spoon over a bed of cooked rice, and serve.",
1671,Make Caldo De Camaron,0,none,1,"Combine the water, herbs, and vegetables.","Pour the water into a large saucepan. Add the flat-leaf parsley, thyme, Mexican oregano, 1/2 a medium onion, 2 carrots, 2 cloves of garlic, and 2 stalks of celery. Place the saucepan on the stove and heat on high until the water boils."
1672,Make Caldo De Camaron,1,none,2,Add the fish head and bones.,"Stir these new ingredients into the mixture. Allow the contents of the saucepan to reach a rolling boil again before reducing the heat to medium-low.   If possible, use bones from lean fish, like bass or cod, and avoid oily fish, like salmon."
1673,Make Caldo De Camaron,2,none,3,Simmer for 15 minutes.,"With the liquid barely at a simmer, allow the stock to cook uncovered for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.   During this time, the flavors should blend together, creating a more flavorful stock. If you want the flavor to be even stronger, you can simmer the broth up to 40 minutes. Never let it return to a boil after its initial simmer, however, since fish stock can quickly become cloudy if it gets too hot or cooks for too long."
1674,Make Caldo De Camaron,3,none,4,Strain.,"Pour the contents of the saucepan through a large, heavy strainer or colander. Reserve the liquid for use as stock in your caldo de camaron recipe. Discard the solid ingredients, including the vegetables and fish bones.   If necessary, remove the fish bones by hand before straining the rest of the liquid. Fish bones can sometimes get caught in the holes of a strainer, clogging them up and preventing the liquid from flowing through readily. Note that this stock can be prepared in advance. If you opt to make the stock before you prepare the rest of the soup, pour the finished stock into an airtight container and refrigerate it for up to four days."
1675,Make Caldo De Camaron,4,none,5,Cover the shrimp in cold water.,"Place the dried shrimp in a medium stockpot and cover them with cold water. Allow the shrimp to sit for 15 minutes.When done, drain the water through a colander and rinse the shrimp. Return the drained and rinsed shrimp to the stockpot. This step is important if you are using dried shrimp or other packaged shrimp. Soaking and rinsing the shrimp before cooking it can help remove any distortions in taste that may have developed during the packaging process."
1676,Make Caldo De Camaron,5,none,6,Let the shrimp simmer in fresh water.,"Cover the shrimp with 1 cup (250 ml) of cold water, or enough water to cover them completely. Bring the contents of the pot to a boil on medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium and let the shrimp gently simmer for 5 to 10 minutes."
1677,Make Caldo De Camaron,6,none,7,Strain the liquid.,"Pour the contents of the stockpot through a colander. Reserve both the shrimp and liquid, but set them aside separately.   The water in which you boiled the shrimp has been flavored with the taste of shrimp. You will add this to your stock just before you finish the soup for an added hint of shrimp in the taste of the broth."
1678,Make Caldo De Camaron,7,none,8,"Remove the heads, tails, and legs.","Allow the shrimp to cool until you can safely handle them with your hands. Peel off the heads, tails, and legs before setting the cooked shrimp aside.   You can yank out the legs and head with your fingers. Similarly, you can pinch the tail and gently pull it off the body using only your fingers. You can remove the shells if desired, but you could also leave the shells on if you want the soup to have a little crunch to it. If you want to peel the shrimp, however, pinch the shell between your fingers starting at the head end of the shrimp. Pull the shell down and off the body of the shrimp using gentle pressure."
1679,Make Caldo De Camaron,8,none,9,Remove the stems and seeds from the chiles.,"Use a knife to cut out the stems and ribs, removing the seeds along with them in the process.   Work carefully. Use food-grade plastic gloves to handle the chiles if you want to avoid getting any of the hot juice on your hands, since the chiles could cause mild skin irritation. Wash your hands well after handling the chiles. Do not touch your eyes before washing your hands, since doing so will cause your eyes to burn."
1680,Make Caldo De Camaron,9,none,10,Toast the chiles.,"Heat a large, dry skillet on medium-high for 2 minutes. Place the chiles on the skillet and toast, 10 to 15 seconds, before flipping them over to the other side and toasting another 10 seconds.   Turn the chiles using tongs. The chiles should brown to the point of charring on both sides. You do not want the entire side to blacken, though. Ideally, the chiles should only be exposed to the heat long enough for a few dark brown spots to develop."
1681,Make Caldo De Camaron,10,none,11,Add the other sauce ingredients.,"Place the tomatoes, garlic, and remaining onion half in the skillet along with the chiles. Cover with water, and let simmer on medium heat for 10 minutes.   Stir the contents of the pan occasionally to prevent them from sticking to the bottom of the skillet."
1682,Make Caldo De Camaron,11,none,12,Puree the sauce.,"Transfer the contents of the pan to a blender or food processor. Puree the ingredients together on high speed until a thin sauce forms.   If you have a handheld electric blender, you could use that instead of a standing blender or food processor. No matter what tool you use, though, try to make the sauce as smooth and thoroughly blended as possible."
1683,Make Caldo De Camaron,12,none,13,Heat the oil in a large stockpot.,"Add the oil to a large stockpot and let it heat for a minute or so on medium temperature.   The oil does not need to be sizzling hot, but it should be warm enough to spread over the bottom of the pot evenly as you turn and rotate the dish."
1684,Make Caldo De Camaron,13,none,14,"Pour the sauce into the pan, directly over the oil.","Allow the sauce the simmer uncovered for 8 to 10 minutes. It should become thicker during this time.   Use the rounded bottom of a ladle to smooth the sauce over the oil in an even layer. Keep the stockpot uncovered during this time. By keeping the stockpot uncovered, you allow more of the liquid to evaporate, thus causing the sauce to thicken. If you cover the stockpot, though, the liquid stays trapped inside, and the sauce will stay thin."
1685,Make Caldo De Camaron,14,none,15,Add the cooking liquid from the shrimp.,"Pour the liquid you reserved upon straining the shrimp into the stockpot. Mix well to combine it with the sauce and cook for an additional 2 minutes, or until the liquid starts to simmer gently."
1686,Make Caldo De Camaron,15,none,16,Add the remaining soup ingredients.,"Pour in the fish stock, then add the potatoes, carrots, and shrimp. Simmer on medium-high heat for 10 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are just barely soft enough to pierce with a fork.   To ensure that your soup cooks well enough within these 10 minutes, cut your carrot slices and potato cubes into pieces that are bite-size to half-bite-size. If you make these pieces any larger, they may take longer to cook. Cooking the soup for much longer than 10 to 15 minutes, however, can result in overcooked shrimp and overly thickened broth."
1687,Make Caldo De Camaron,16,none,17,Serve hot.,"The caldo de camaron is done. Ladle the hot soup into individual serving bowls and garnish each serving with chopped avocado, chopped red onion, fresh chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of fresh juice from a lime wedge.Store any leftover soup in the refrigerator or freezer.It should last for 3 days in the refrigerator or up to 1 month in the freezer. To successfully store the soup:  Fill your sink with cold water and add a tray or two of ice. Dunk the bottom of the soup pot in the water to cool the leftover soup quickly. Pour the extra soup in the freezer-safe plastic bags. Label each bag with the contents and current date. Place the bags in your refrigerator to cool or lay them flat in your freezer. Freeze them in a single layer initially, and stack the bags in your freezer once the soup has frozen solid. Thaw frozen soup overnight in the refrigerator. Reheat the soup over low to medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, before serving."

1733,Make 'Rosca De Pascua,2,none,3,Make the dough.,"Make sure that all of the ingredients are well mixed. Now, add the butter, cut into small cubes so that it will be easier to integrate into the dough.   Place the dough on a clean surface and knead it until it becomes smooth. Its consistency should be somewhat ""sticky."""
1734,Make 'Rosca De Pascua,3,none,4,Let the dough rise.,Put the dough in a container and cover it with plastic wrap. Allow it to rise for two hours and make sure that it is far away from any heat sources.
1735,Make 'Rosca De Pascua,4,none,5,Assemble the Easter bread ring.,"The last thing that you should do to get the dough ready for cooking is to remove excess gasses. Take the previously risen dough and apply slight pressure with the palm of your hand until it becomes smaller.   Knead and stretch the dough a bit. Use your elbow to make a pit in the middle of the dough; then, use your hands to finish making the ring shape. Place the ring on a baking sheet and flatten it out.

1800,Make Conchas,0,none,1,Proof the yeast.,"Pour the warm water into a large bowl. Stir in the yeast and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of the granulated sugar until combined. Let the mixture stand for 10 minutes.The water must be much warmer than room temperature but not hot enough to steam. As the yeast stands, foam should begin to form. If no foam forms after the 10 minutes pass, the yeast might be dead, and your bread will not rise at all. If this is the case, you should start over with a new packet of yeast.;"
1801,Make Conchas,1,none,2,Scald the milk.,"The milk should be at least as warm as the water. Pour it into a small saucepan and slowly heat it on the stove over medium-low heat, stirring continually to prevent it from burning. Remove the milk from the heat as soon as steam starts to form.   Set the milk off to the side and allow it to cool for a few minutes. When it stops steaming, the milk should be sufficiently cool."
1802,Make Conchas,2,none,3,"Combine the milk, yeast mixture, and most of the other dough ingredients.","Pour the warm milk into the proofed yeast. Also add the remaining sugar, unsalted butter, eggs, salt, cinnamon, and half of the flour. Stir until thoroughly combined.   You could try mixing the dough with a mixing spoon, but you will have better luck if you use your hands, especially once you add more of the flour and the dough starts to become thicker. If you have a stand mixer with a dough attachment, you could use that instead of using your hands."
1803,Make Conchas,3,none,4,Gradually add the remaining flour.,"Divide the remaining flour into thirds. Add it to the dough mixture one third at a time, mixing well after each addition. Continue to mix after the final addition until the dough has come together completely.   Do not add all the flour at once. Mixing the flour into the dough a little at a time makes the process easier and ensures that the moist ingredients are blended into the dough at more equal intervals. Continue mixing with your hands. You could also use a stand mixer with a dough hook attachment."
1804,Make Conchas,4,none,5,Knead the dough.,"Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Dust your hands with flour, and knead the dough by hand for 5 to 10 minutes, until it becomes less sticky and forms a smooth, elastic mass.   If the dough starts to stick at any point as you knead it, sprinkle more flour onto the counter, your hands, or over the surface of the dough. You do not want to add too much extra flour into the dough, but you do need enough to prevent it from sticking to everything it comes into contact with."
1805,Make Conchas,5,none,6,Let rise until doubled.Place the ball of dough into an oiled mixing bowl and cover it with plastic wrap or a wet dish towel.,"Set it aside in a warm space for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the dough has doubled in size.   The bowl you place the dough in should be about twice the current size of the dough to allow the dough enough room to expand. Use nonstick cooking spray or vegetable oil to coat the bowl before you place the bowl inside. This prevents the dough from sticking. Ideally, the dough should sit at a temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) as it rises. One option is to preheat the oven to its lowest setting, turn it off, and place the dough in the still warm oven with the oven door slightly cracked."
1806,Make Conchas,6,none,7,Cream together the butter and sugar.Combine the unsalted butter and topping sugar in a large bowl.,"Beat the two together with an electric mixer at medium speed until the mixture becomes fluffy and less dense.   Use powdered sugar if you want your topping to be smooth. If you prefer a somewhat grainy texture, use granulated sugar."
1807,Make Conchas,7,none,8,Add the vanilla and flour.,"Add the vanilla extract and flour to the contents of the bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium-low speed until well-mixed.   The resulting dough should somewhat resemble cookie dough. If you want to add a little cinnamon to the topping dough, do so when you add the vanilla and flour."
1808,Make Conchas,8,none,9,Divide in half.,"Separate the topping dough into two equal portions. One portion can remain in its current bowl, but the second should be transferred to another bowl.   By following these instructions, you can create a chocolate topping and a colored vanilla topping. If you only want to make one topping for the conchas, though, you can add the other topping ingredients to the full batch of topping dough instead of dividing the dough into two separate portions."
1809,Make Conchas,9,none,10,Add cocoa to one half.,"Sprinkle the cocoa powder over one half of the dough. Blend it into the dough using your hands or a mixing spoon until the entire half is a rich, even brown.   Note that the cocoa powder is technically optional. If you do not want any chocolate topping, you can skip it. Leave the dough colorless or add food coloring to it as instructed to do with the second half. Similarly, you could use cocoa powder to flavor and color both halves of the topping. To do so, simply double the total amount of cocoa powder called for in the original recipe and add it to the full batch of dough without dividing the dough into halves."
1810,Make Conchas,10,none,11,Add food coloring to the other half.,"Mix half a dozen to a dozen drops of your favorite food coloring hue to the other half of the dough. Work the food coloring into the topping dough using your hands or mixing spoon, and continue mixing until the color is evenly dispersed through the dough.   Note that you can add more food coloring if you want a deeper color. If you do not want to use food coloring, you can color this half with cocoa powder or leave it colorless, instead."
1811,Make Conchas,11,none,12,Divide the dough into 12 to 16 rolls.,"Gently punch down the risen dough. Separate the full bulk of dough into 12 to 16 evenly sized portions, and roll each portion into a ball.   Spread these balls of dough onto two lightly greased baking sheets. Leave at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) of space in between each ball of dough. Gently press on the top of each piece of dough to somewhat flatten the top. The rolls should be round, but the top needs to be somewhat flat for when you add the topping."
1812,Make Conchas,12,none,13,Divide the topping into the same number of pieces.,"Separate the topping dough into 12 or 16 pieces, depending on how many rolls you made with the bread dough. Make sure that half of the pieces are chocolate and half are vanilla.   Roll each piece of topping into a ball. Place each ball, one at a time, in between two pieces of plastic wrap or parchment paper. Press down on it with your hands or with a rolling pin to flatten the ball into a circle. Each circle should be large enough to completely cover the top of one roll."
1813,Make Conchas,13,none,14,Place the topping on the rolls.,"Arrange the flattened circles of topping onto the rolls, one piece of topping per roll. Carefully press down around the edge of the topping dough to secure it into the bread dough.   The two doughs do not need to be blended together, but they should stick together securely. To test the strength of the bond, carefully tip the roll upside-down after placing the topping on. The topping should remain on even when upside-down. If it falls off or if a side starts to fall off, press it into the dough a little more firmly and try again."
1814,Make Conchas,14,none,15,Cut patterns into the topping.,"The patterns you choose should resemble seashells. Gently draw the patterns into the topping using a toothpick. The lines should be deep, but not deep enough to completely cut through to the other side of the topping or into the roll itself.   The name of this sweet bread roll, ""conchas,"" is also the Spanish word for ""seashells."" In other words, the bread is named for this seashell design, which is why it is an important aspect of authentic conchas. Get creative. Try to mimic the appearance of a clam shell, or create a snail-like spiral pattern. If all else fails, you could just draw a criss-cross pattern over the top."
1815,Make Conchas,15,none,16,Let the dough rest.,"Loosely cover the rolls with a damp dish towel or plastic wrap. Place the bread back in a warm location and allow the rolls to rise again for another 45 minutes.   As before, the dough should nearly double in size after it finishes rising."
1816,Make Conchas,16,none,17,Preheat the oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190 degrees Celsius).,"To save time, begin preheating the oven while the conchas rise.   Ideally, the oven should be ready a little before or as soon as the rolls have finished rising."
1817,Make Conchas,17,none,18,Bake for 15 to 20 minutes.,"Place both baking sheets into the preheated oven, placing them on the middle rack if possible. Allow the rolls to bake until the bread turns a light golden brown color.   Work gently as you place the dough in the oven. If you move the rolls around too recklessly, you could partially deflate them. Pay attention to the color of the bread dough and not the color of the topping. Since the topping has been colored with cocoa powder and food coloring, it will be harder to see any browning on it. The golden brown color should be much easier to spot on the bread itself, though."
1818,Make Conchas,18,none,19,Let cool.,Remove the conchas from the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes on their baking sheets. Lift them from the baking sheets and transfer them to a wire cooling rack to finish the cooling process.
1819,Make Conchas,19,none,20,Enjoy.,"At this point, the conchas are ready to eat and enjoy. You can eat them while they are still a little warm, or you could wait until they have cooled to room temperature.   If you decide to save any conchas for later, let them cool completely to room temperature first. Place the cooled rolls into an airtight container and store them at room temperature for a few days."
1820,Make Manicotti,0,none,1,Smooth together 15 oz. (444 ml) of ricotta cheese and 4 oz. (118 ml) of cream cheese in a large bowl.;,
1821,Make Manicotti,1,none,2,Stir in 8 oz. (236 ml) of mozzarella cheese and 4 oz. (118 ml) Parmesan or Romano cheese.,
1822,Make Manicotti,2,none,3,Fold in 2 large eggs.,
1823,Make Manicotti,3,none,4,Stir in 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) of salt and 1/2 tsp. (2.5 ml) pepper.,Depending on your preference you can add a 10 oz. (296 ml) of package of frozen spinach that has been thawed and squeezed dry. You may also add 1 lb. (473 ml) of browned ground beef or Italian sausage to your cheese mixture. Even a small package of sliced pepperoni can be added at this point for a spicier manicotti recipe.
1824,Make Manicotti,4,none,5,Spoon the cheese mixture into a plastic storage bag and cut one corner.,
1825,Make Manicotti,5,none,6,"Spread approximately 1 1/2 cups (355 ml) of marinara sauce, from a jar or homemade, into the bottom of a 9 x 13 baking dish.",
1826,Make Manicotti,6,none,7,Open 1 box of 12 to 14 uncooked manicotti shells.,
1827,Make Manicotti,7,none,8,"Pipe the cheese mixture into each uncooked shell by squeezing the plastic bag, forcing the cheese mixture through the hole that you cut.",
1828,Make Manicotti,8,none,9,"Place each filled shell into the sauced baking dish, arranging them into 2 even rows.",
1829,Make Manicotti,9,none,10,"Boil the manicotti shells in a large pot of salted water for approximately 4 to 6 minutes until they are slightly softened, but still firm.",
1830,Make Manicotti,10,none,11,"Drain the shells through a colander, taking care not to tear any of them.",
1831,Make Manicotti,11,none,12,Leave the shells in the colander and allow to cool slightly.,
1832,Make Manicotti,12,none,13,Remove 1 shell at a time and pipe in the cheese mixture.,
1833,Make Manicotti,13,none,14,"Place each filled shell into the sauce lined baking dish, arranging them into 2 even rows.",
1834,Make Manicotti,14,none,15,Cover the filled shells (both uncooked and cooked methods) with 1 1/2 cups to 2 1/2 cups (355 ml to 591 ml) of marinara sauce.,
1835,Make Manicotti,15,none,16,Sprinkle 4 oz.,(118 ml) of Parmesan or Romano cheese over the top.
1836,Make Manicotti,16,none,17,Bake at 350 degrees F (176 degrees C.)Bake the uncooked shells covered with foil for 50 minutes.,Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Bake the cooked shells uncovered for 30 to 35 minutes.
1837,Make Manicotti,17,none,18,Serve warm.,
1838,Make Bunuelos,0,A,A1,Combine the dry ingredients.,"Place the flour, baking powder, salt, and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of sugar in a large bowl. Stir until combined.While not strictly necessary, consider sifting the flour once or twice before adding the other ingredients. Doing so removes lumps and introduces air into the mixture, which should create lighter buñuelos.;"
1839,Make Bunuelos,1,A,A2,"Add the egg, butter, and vanilla.","Form a well in the center of the flour mixture. Add the egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract to the center of that well. Mix to combine.   When mixing in these liquid ingredients, knock a little flour from the sides of the well into the liquids, then mix without disturbing the rest of the well. Repeat, working with small amounts of the flour mixture at a time. Once the liquids are thick enough to hold their form, you can incorporate them into the rest of the flour. Continue mixing until all the ingredients are combined and the resulting dough seems like coarse crumbs."
1840,Make Bunuelos,2,A,A3,Gradually add the water.,"Add warm water to the dough 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, mixing after each addition. Continue until you've added 3/4 cup (80 ml) of water total.   Once the dough comes together, start kneading it after each addition, too. Continue working with the dough for about 5 minutes, or until it seems soft, stretchy, and smooth."
1841,Make Bunuelos,3,A,A4,Let the dough rest for 30 minutes.,Cover the bowl of dough with a clean towel and set it aside. Let it rest in room temperature to warm conditions for approximately 30 minutes.   Continue with your preparations as the dough rests.
1842,Make Bunuelos,4,A,A5,"Meanwhile, mix the cinnamon and remaining sugar.",Combine the cinnamon with the remaining 1 cup (250 ml) of sugar. Stir until evenly mixed.Set aside the cinnamon-sugar mixture until later. You'll use this as a topping for the buñuelos once they're done.
1843,Make Bunuelos,5,A,A6,Heat the oil.,Pour 1 inch (2.5 cm) of oil into a large frying pan with heavy sides. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat.   The oil will need to reach a temperature between 350 and 360 degrees Fahrenheit (177 and 182 degrees Celsius) before you can fry the buñuelos. Monitor the temperature of the oil using candy or frying thermometer.You should also prepare your working area at this time. Sprinkle flour over the counter and over the rolling pin. Line a plate with clean paper towels or brown paper bags.
1844,Make Bunuelos,6,A,A7,Divide the dough into 12 balls.,"After 30 minutes pass, divide the batch of dough into 12 small, evenly sized balls.   If the dough starts sticking to your hands, dust your hands with flour before you continue working with it."
1845,Make Bunuelos,7,A,A8,Flatten the dough.,"Flatten each ball of dough using a rolling pin, inverted bowl, or your hands. Each portion should be flattened until it is very thin and roughly 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.   To use a rolling pin: place the dough on your floured work surface and roll over it until you get an evenly round tortilla. To use an inverted bowl: place a pastry towel over the bowl and spread the ball of dough over it. Use your hands to gently stretch the dough over the sides of the bowl, pulling down on the dough very gently as you work. To use your hands: dust your hands with flour and pat each ball of dough in between them. Gently pat and stretch the dough into a round tortilla."
1846,Make Bunuelos,8,A,A9,Fry until crispy.,"Place the raw dough into the hot oil. Fry each buñuelo for about 3 minutes, turning once halfway through.   When ready, the buñuelos should become puffy, crispy, and golden brown. Note that you should only fry one portion of dough at a time. Add more oil as needed and check the temperature in between batches."
1847,Make Bunuelos,9,A,A10,Drain off the excess oil.,Remove the finished buñuelo from the hot oil and transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels. All the excess oil to drain off for several seconds.
1848,Make Bunuelos,10,A,A11,Serve with cinnamon-sugar.,"Sprinkle the finished buñuelos with the cinnamon-sugar mixture and enjoy them while they're still warm.   If you pile the finished buñuelos together, they should remain warm until you finish frying the last one. If they seem too cool, however, preheat your oven to its lowest setting and place the batch of buñuelos inside for 5 minutes."
1849,Make Bunuelos,11,B,B1,Combine the dough ingredients.,"Place the grated cheese, cornstarch, tapioca starch, sugar, eggs, salt, butter, and baking powder in a large bowl. Mix the ingredients together until a soft, smooth dough forms.Traditionally, Colombian buñuelos are made with a cheese called queso costeño, which is nearly impossible to find outside of Columbia. To obtain a similar flavor, use 1-1/2 cups (150 g) of Mexican queso fresco plus 1/2 cup (50 g) of dry feta cheese. If queso fresco is unavailable, you could use fresh farmer's cheese."
1850,Make Bunuelos,12,B,B2,"Add milk, if necessary.","If the dough seems dry, add milk 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time, kneading well after each addition.   Stop adding milk once the dough is smooth and holds together. Adding too much milk will make the dough too sticky."
1851,Make Bunuelos,13,B,B3,Roll the dough into small balls.,"Pinch off small portions of dough. Roll each portion of dough in between your hands, working it into a smooth ball.   If the dough sticks to your hands as you work with it, lightly dust your hands with flour or additional starch. Note that each ball should be about 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.5 cm) in diameter."
1852,Make Bunuelos,14,B,B4,Heat the oil.,"Pour 3 inches (7.6 cm) of vegetable oil into a deep pan with a heavy bottom. Heat the oil on your stove until it reaches 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).   If one is available, you may use a deep fryer instead of a deep pan. Use a candy or frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. The maximum temperature should be 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius), but you can probably cook the buñuelos without difficulty once the oil reaches 300 degrees Fahrenheit (150 degrees Celsius)."
1853,Make Bunuelos,15,B,B5,Cook the buñuelos until golden brown.,"Drop several buñuelos into the warm oil. Fry them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they turn golden brown on all sides.   Fry the buñuelos in small batches to avoid over-crowding the pan. They should be able to float around without knocking into one another. Expect the balls of dough to sink when you first drop them into the oil. After 30 to 60 seconds, though, bubbles should gather around the sides and the ball should float to the top. You'll need to stir and turn the buñuelos with a slotted spoon as they start browning. Otherwise, they may not brown evenly."
1854,Make Bunuelos,16,B,B6,Drain off the excess oil.,Remove the finished buñuelos from the hot oil and transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels or brown paper bags.   Let the oil drain off for at least 30 to 60 seconds. Pile the drained buñuelos onto a separate dish while you finish the entire batch. The residual heat from the latest ones should help keep the earlier ones warm while you finish frying.
1855,Make Bunuelos,17,B,B7,Serve warm.,"Buñuelos are best served hot or warm. You can still enjoy them once they cool to room temperature, too."
1856,Make Chicago Style Pizza,0,none,1,Pour 1 1/2 cups (355.5 ml) of warm water into a large mixing bowl.,The water should be at a temperature of 110 °F (43.3 °C) (43.3 C).       ;
1857,Make Chicago Style Pizza,1,none,2,Add 1 package of active dry yeast and 1 tsp.,"(5 g) of sugar to the warm water, stir to combine, and leave for about 5 minutes until the mixture begins to foam."
1858,Make Chicago Style Pizza,2,none,3,"Place 1 1/2 cups (338 g) of all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup (113 g) of semolina flour, 1/2 cup (118.5 ml) of vegetable oil and 1 tsp.",(5 g) of salt into the yeast mixture in the bowl once it had foamed.
1859,Make Chicago Style Pizza,3,none,4,"Combine all of the ingredients using your hands until there are no major lumps of flour, yeast or salt.",
1860,Make Chicago Style Pizza,4,none,5,"Add the remaining 2 cups (454 g) of all-purpose flour slowly while using your hands to work it into the dough, until you form a cohesive ball that is only a bit sticky.",
1861,Make Chicago Style Pizza,5,none,6,"Place the dough onto a flat, floured surface and begin to knead it until it is smooth and less sticky.",The kneading process should take about 3 to 5 minutes.
1862,Make Chicago Style Pizza,6,none,7,"Rub some oil around the inside of a large mixing bowl, coating it evenly.",
1863,Make Chicago Style Pizza,7,none,8,"Place the ball of dough into the oiled bowl and turn it to coat it evenly with oil, and then cover the bowl with a layer of plastic wrap and place it in a warm place for 1 to 1 1/2 hours to rise.",
1864,Make Chicago Style Pizza,8,none,9,Remove the dough from the bowl when its size has doubled after an hour and divide it into 2 equal pieces.,
1865,Make Chicago Style Pizza,9,none,10,Turn on the oven to heat at 475 °F (246 °C) (240 C).,
1866,Make Chicago Style Pizza,10,none,11,Oil a 12-in.,(30.5cm) deep-dish pizza pan.
1867,Make Chicago Style Pizza,11,none,12,"Place a ball of dough into the center of the pan, and begin to press and stretch it to fill the bottom of the pan and work it 1/2 in.",(1.3 cm) up the side of the pan on all sides.
1868,Make Chicago Style Pizza,12,none,13,Leave the dough to rest in the pan for 5 minutes.,
1869,Make Chicago Style Pizza,13,none,14,"Place a layer of mozzarella cheese across the bottom of the pizza, then top with tomato sauce.",
1870,Make Chicago Style Pizza,14,none,15,"Add any of your preferred pizza toppings over the tomato sauce, then place in the oven for 30 minutes.",
1871,Make Chicago Style Pizza,15,none,16,Let cool for a few minutes and then serve.,
1872,Make Sausage and Penne Pasta,0,none,1,Bring enough water to boil.,"Cook the pasta as per package directions. Add salt to taste. It normally takes between 11 to 12 minutes for al dente pasta.   Adding oil is not necessary but if you prefer doing that, you can do so.;"
1873,Make Sausage and Penne Pasta,1,none,2,Sauté the sausages in olive oil.,"Cook until they are slightly browned, to your liking. This will probably take about 8-10 minutes. Add a bit of garlic salt. You may like to try layering spices (for example, salt, pepper, etc.) to the dish, to see if it tastes better that way."
1874,Make Sausage and Penne Pasta,2,none,3,Add the spinach.,"Cook until slightly limp. Take note that spinach leaves cook very quickly, so you might need to turn down the heat a little bit."
1875,Make Sausage and Penne Pasta,3,none,4,Add the cooked pasta.,"Then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle over the garlic salt and the lemon pepper. Make sure to taste it as you go, so that it doesn't turn out to be too salty."
1876,Make Sausage and Penne Pasta,4,none,5,"Add the feta cheese last, and some lemon juice and a little shaved rind.",Don't add too much or it will be too sour.
1877,Make Sausage and Penne Pasta,5,none,6,Remove from the heat.,Place on dishes and serve immediately.
1878,Make a Monte Cristo Sandwich,0,none,1,"Put two slices of ham, and one slice of cheese between two pieces of bread.",This will make four sandwiches in all.;
1879,Make a Monte Cristo Sandwich,1,none,2,Whisk four eggs and one third cup milk in a small bowl.,
1880,Make a Monte Cristo Sandwich,2,none,3,Dip sandwiches in the egg and milk mixture.,
1881,Make a Monte Cristo Sandwich,3,none,4,Melt butter on the large skillet or griddle.,
1882,Make a Monte Cristo Sandwich,4,none,5,Place sandwiches on griddle when the butter is bubbling.,

1888,Make Framed Eggs,0,none,1,Take the bread and cut a circular hole into it big enough to fit a raw egg in but small enough so the egg won't fall out.,;
1890,Make Framed Eggs,2,none,3,Put 1 slice of butter on the pan for each egg.,
1892,Make Framed Eggs,4,none,5,Put the bread in the pan.,Usually the pan can hold three pieces of bread.

1901,Make Framed Eggs,13,none,14,Serve and enjoy.,
1903,Clean Trout for Cooking,0,none,1,Insert the tip of your knife into the exit hole.,"Hold the trout by its dorsal edge and turn it over to expose the belly. You’ll find the exit hole near the tail end of the fish just under the lower fins. Point the blade toward the head, then slide it in smoothly.To dress a fish quickly and efficiently, it’s important to use a sharp filleting knife that offers a little flexibility. This will allow you to make more precise cuts.You’ll be exposed to blood, excrement and other bodily tissues while cleaning trout. It's a good idea to wear rubber gloves to protect you from germs.;"
1904,Clean Trout for Cooking,1,none,2,Cut the trout up through the belly.,"Run the knife along the length of the fish, stopping just before you reach the head. This cut doesn’t need to be very deep—just apply enough pressure to get through the soft skin on the underbelly without damaging the internal organs.Be extremely careful when handling the knife, as you’ll be cutting in the direction of your opposite hand. Keeping the organs intact while you open the belly will make them easier to remove later on."
1905,Clean Trout for Cooking,2,none,3,Use your knife to pierce the underside of the jaw.,Hold the trout upright and stick the blade of the knife straight through the jaw beneath the lower “lip.” Keep pushing it until it comes out the other side. The blade should be situated above the tongue but below the jawbone itself.Be sure to start on the side closest to you so you’re moving the blade away from yourself. Use a slight back and forth motion to help work the blade through the tough skin around the jaw.
1906,Clean Trout for Cooking,3,none,4,Slice through the jaw towards the mouth.,"Push the blade forward until it cuts clean through the tissue of the jaw. There should now be a small flap hanging down beneath the mouth of the trout. You’ll use this opening as a fingerhold to strip away the entrails.If you’re working with a knife that doesn’t offer quite as much dexterity, you can also cut partway through the backbone and remove both the head and intestines at the same time."
1907,Clean Trout for Cooking,4,none,5,Hook your finger through the jaw.,"Turn the trout so that its head is pointed upwards, belly facing you. Insert one finger into the mouth and down through the jaw flap you just opened. Pinch the jawbone between your thumb and forefinger.Watch out for any sharp, pointy teeth you might encounter inside the mouth of the trout."
1908,Clean Trout for Cooking,5,none,6,Strip the intestines in one smooth motion.,"Grip the jawbone firmly with your finger, then pull down as you hold the fish securely with your other hand. The entire lower jaw and abdomen should come free in one piece, taking the intestines with it.Remove the intestines carefully to avoid tearing them or damaging the rest of the fish. Using the jawbone method can save you the trouble of having to dig out the entrails by hand."
1909,Clean Trout for Cooking,6,none,7,Scrape out the blood line.,"Spread the belly of the trout open. Inside, you should see a dark red line sitting in the groove behind the backbone. Drag the tip of your finger along this groove to clear out the black gunk inside. You may need to pull the connective tissue free in places where it's more firmly attached.You can also use an old toothbrush or similar utensil to break up the membrane holding the blood line in place.Don’t neglect to remove the blood line. Most fishing experts agree that leaving it in negatively affects the flavor of the cooked fish."
1910,Clean Trout for Cooking,7,none,8,"Remove the head, tail and scales.","Proceed to cut off the head just behind the gill vent and the tail around where you made the initial incision at the exit hole. Rake the outside of the fish from head to tail with the edge of a knife or spoon to scrape off the scales, then peel away the skin starting at one corner.Alternatively, you can cook the trout whole, then deal with the inedible parts once it’s soft and pliable.You should always remove the scales, even if you’re planning on cooking and eating the fish with the skin on."
1911,Clean Trout for Cooking,8,none,9,Rinse out the trout thoroughly.,"Run a stream of cool water into the body cavity to flush away any remaining blood, tissue and other material. Set the trout aside on a layer of folded paper towels to absorb excess water until you’re ready to cook it or put it away.To really sanitize the fish, scrub it inside and out with distilled white vinegar, using a small soft-bristled brush."
1912,Clean Trout for Cooking,9,none,10,Cut the fillets free from the backbone.,"Lay the trout flat against the cutting board with the backbone facing towards you. Run the blade of your knife all the way along the spine. Set the first fillet aside, then flip the fish over and repeat on the opposite side.Cut using long, smooth strokes with the knife rather than short, jagged ones. This will make the resulting fillets come away cleaner with less wasted meat. Press down on the fish with your non-cutting hand to help hold it place while you work the first fillet free."
1913,Clean Trout for Cooking,10,none,11,Trim the fillets at the top and bottom.,"There will likely be traces of fat and cartilage clinging to either edge of the fillets where they were attached to the belly and backbone. To get rid of these bits, point the tip of the knife downwards against the cutting board and trace along the outline of the extra tissue. Carefully cut away any tissue you find that isn't usable meat.The white fat and cartilage will usually stand out against the darker meat of the trout. These tissues tend to be tough and chewy, even after cooking, and can ruin the velvety texture of the trout if not properly trimmed."
1914,Clean Trout for Cooking,11,none,12,Remove the pinbones.,"Using a pair of tweezers, go through and pluck out each of the tiny pinbones, or the ribs of the trout. Push down gently on the meat around the bones to expose the tip, then get a good grip and tug until the entire bone slides out. If you wait until after you've filleted the trout to extract the bones, they'll no longer be anchored in place and shouldn't give you any trouble.Pull out the pinbones in the direction they run through the fillet (not straight up) to prevent them from breaking accidentally.If you don't have a pair of tweezers on hand, you can also use another thin, pointed tool, such as needle-nosed pliers or the tines of a fork."
1915,Clean Trout for Cooking,12,none,13,Keep the fish on ice.,"After reeling in your fresh catch, place it in an ice-filled cooler immediately. The trout needs to stay cold in order to slow down decomposition. Make sure the cooler you bring along with you is large enough to accommodate a large haul.Drain the cooler periodically and repack it with fresh ice—soaking in water for too long will dull the flavor of the fish. On all-day outings, you can also keep the trout alive by pulling it alongside the boat on a stringer or transferring it a large container full of fresh water."
1916,Clean Trout for Cooking,13,none,14,Watch out for parasites.,"Certain species of freshwater fish have been known to harbor parasites, which can be harmful if ingested. Inspect the body cavity and meat of the trout closely before you cook and eat it. Most visible parasites look like tiny worms or insects, and may be found on the inside or outside of the fish.Disposing of the skin and intestines will eliminate the majority of parasites, while making sure the fish is properly cooked will take care of the rest. Not all parasites can be seen with the naked eye. To minimize health risks, cook the trout for at least five minutes at 140°F (60°C) or higher."

The thicker slices will need to cook longer, but there will be less chance that the sausage filling will crumble as it heats.You can also begin slicing the sausage while it’s still in the plastic wrapper and remove the plastic and the skin together.Blood sausages like black pudding have a more delicate consistency because they contain very little actual meat. The oats and grains inside will not hold up as well to cooking as meatier sausages.;"
2001,Cook Black Pudding,1,A,A2,Remove the skin.,"Make a small incision at the edge of each slice with your knife and then peel away the skin. Be careful not to damage the sausage as you are cutting and peeling. Removing the skin the black pudding prior to cooking will allow it to get more evenly done, and will also make it easier to eat.Use a sharpened knife to keep from mashing the sausage as you slice it."
2002,Cook Black Pudding,2,A,A3,Place the pudding slices in a hot frying pan.,"Turn the stove on to a medium heat and begin heating a pan large enough to hold 2-3 pudding slices. If you prefer, you can use an ounce of butter or a tablespoon of oil to fry the black pudding, though this is not necessary due to the high fat content of the sausage. Place the slices flat in the pan and let them start cooking.Black pudding will cook just fine in its own fat, much like bacon or other varieties of sausage. Butter and oil can be used for flavor and to give the outer layer an extra crispy finish. For a traditional English breakfast, add other ingredients to the pan that can be fried at the same time—eggs, bacon, potatoes, and other sausages are all fair game."
2003,Cook Black Pudding,3,A,A4,Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side.,"Fry the black pudding slices for 3-4 minutes before turning them. Keep a close eye on them as they cook—because of their dark color, it can be hard to tell when they are done. A properly fried pudding should be black and crisp on the outside, with a soft center slightly lighter in color.Black pudding that has been overcooked will become shriveled and hard as it loses moisture."
2005,Cook Black Pudding,5,B,B2,Slice the black pudding and remove the skin.,Cut the pudding into half-inch-thick slices. Nick the casing along the outer edge of each slice and peel back the skin.  Slice the pudding thick if it is to serve as a main course. Thinner slices can be chopped or crumbled after they’re cooked and added to other dishes.
2006,Cook Black Pudding,6,B,B3,Arrange the pudding slices on a baking sheet.,Spray a large pan or baking sheet with oil. Lay out the slices on the baking sheet an even distance apart. Place the baking sheet in the oven on the center rack.
2007,Cook Black Pudding,7,B,B4,Bake for 10-20 minutes.,"The pudding should remain in the oven for around 10-20 minutes, depending on thickness, or until the outside has begun to crisp. Take a peek at the pudding’s progress after it has been baking for several minutes to make sure is isn’t getting too done. The circulating heat of the oven will cook the pudding more evenly than frying.Turn the pudding slices at the halfway mark to get them crisp and caramelized on both sides. Preparing black pudding in the oven can be a time-saving tactic if you’re also making other dishes and don’t have time to watch a frying pan."
2009,Cook Black Pudding,9,C,C2,Bring a large pot of water to a boil.,"Fill a stock pot with water and heat it until it comes to a boil. You can also use a deep pan to simmer the black pudding, though this will take longer and require regular turning. The pot or pan you use should be big enough to hold the entire pudding.Simmering will work best with thinner sausages. The bulky girth of thick sausages makes heating them in a pan impractical."
2010,Cook Black Pudding,10,C,C3,Put in the pudding whole.,"Carefully place the black pudding into the boiling water. It will submerge when placed in a stock pot. If you’ve chosen to simmer the pudding in a pan, you will need to turn it every few minutes to make sure it gets cooked through.  Turn simmering sausages using long-handled tongs to keep from burning yourself. Boiling sausages will need to be checked periodically to ensure that the skin hasn’t ruptured. If it has, remove the black pudding from the water immediately, slice and finish cooking on a skillet or in the oven to salvage the flavor and texture of the sausage."
2013,Cook Kohlrabi,1,A,A2,Cut the kohlrabi into pieces.,"Slice each kohlrabi bulb into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick pieces and cut each of these pieces in half.  For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger."
2014,Cook Kohlrabi,2,A,A3,Combine the seasonings.,"In a large bowl, add together the olive oil, minced garlic, salt, and pepper, mixing well to combine.  If you do not have fresh garlic on hand, you could substitute 1/8 tsp (2/3 ml) of garlic powder."
2015,Cook Kohlrabi,3,A,A4,Coat the kohlrabi.,"Toss the kohlrabi pieces into the seasoned olive oil, stirring well to coat each piece.  The garlic does not need to stick to each piece of kohlrabi, but it should still be distributed among the pieces fairly evenly. Break up any large clumps of garlic with your mixing spoon to prevent the garlic flavor from becoming too concentrated in one area."
2016,Cook Kohlrabi,4,A,A5,Transfer the kohlrabi to your prepared baking sheet.,"Spread the kohlrabi pieces out onto the baking sheet in a single, flat layer.  The kohlrabi needs to be restricted to a single layer. If you end up piling it onto the sheet, some pieces may cook faster than others."
2017,Cook Kohlrabi,5,A,A6,Bake until browned.,This should take roughly 15 to 20 minutes.  Stir the pieces occasionally using a spatula to ensure even browning.
2018,Cook Kohlrabi,6,A,A7,Sprinkle with cheese.,"Sprinkle the Parmesan cheese over the cooked kohlrabi before returning it to the oven. Let roast for another 5 minutes, or until the Parmesan cheese becomes lightly toasted and browned.  Remove from the oven once you see the Parmesan brown. If you end up using shredded Parmesan instead of grated, you should let the shredded Parmesan melt evenly before removing the dish."
2019,Cook Kohlrabi,7,A,A8,Serve hot.,"As soon as the cheese melts and browns, you should remove the kohlrabi from the oven and enjoy the dish immediately."
2020,Cook Kohlrabi,8,B,B1,Cut the kohlrabi into bite-sized pieces.,"Slice the kohlrabi bulbs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces, and cut each slice into 1-inch (2.5-cm) chunks.  Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger."
2021,Cook Kohlrabi,9,B,B2,Place the kohlrabi pieces in a saucepan.,"Fill the saucepan with 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) of water and add a dash of salt.  Do not fill the pan with water any higher than this. If you use too much water, you could end up boiling the kohlrabi instead of steaming it. A low level of water will give you just enough to create steam."
2022,Cook Kohlrabi,10,B,B3,Boil the water.,Cover the pan and bring the water to a boil over high heat.  The lid is necessary to trap the steam. The high heat is also necessary because it creates more steam at a quicker rate.
2023,Cook Kohlrabi,11,B,B4,Reduce heat and steam.,"Reduce the heat to low and let the kohlrabi steam for 5 to 7 minutes, or until soft enough to pierce with a fork.  Note that you can also steam the kohlrabi leaves, if desired. Steam the leaves as you would steam spinach, cooking them for about 5 minutes. When done, drain the kohlrabi by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander."
2024,Cook Kohlrabi,12,B,B5,Serve.,The steamed kohlrabi can be enjoyed hot and as is.
2026,Cook Kohlrabi,14,C,C2,Chop the kohlrabi.,"Cut each kohlrabi bulb into thin slices and chop each slice into tiny pieces. Transfer the kohlrabi to a large mixing bowl.  For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger."
2027,Cook Kohlrabi,15,C,C3,Season the kohlrabi.,"Drizzle olive oil over the chopped pieces and add a dash of salt and pepper. Mix well so that all the pieces are evenly coated.  You could also add other flavors and seasonings in, as well. For instance, garlic, onion, and chives all work well with the taste of kohlrabi."
2029,Cook Kohlrabi,17,C,C5,Cook for 10 to 12 minutes.,"You do not need to stir the kohlrabi during this time. When done, the pieces should be tender-crisp and easy to pierce with a fork."
2031,Cook Kohlrabi,19,D,D1,Warm up the oil.,Pour the olive oil into a skillet and heat it over medium-high heat for 1 to 2 minutes.  The oil should be smooth and glossy but not so hot that it begins to steam.
2032,Cook Kohlrabi,20,D,D2,Dice the kohlrabi bulbs.,"Cut the kohlrabi into very small pieces. Slice the bulbs into 1/4-inch (6.35-mm) thick slices, if not thinner, and chop each slice into even finer minced pieces.  For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger."
2033,Cook Kohlrabi,21,D,D3,Cook the garlic.,"Add the minced garlic to the hot oil and stir-fry for about 1 minute, just until it becomes fragrant and lightly toasted.  Watch the garlic carefully as you cook it. Garlic can burn easily, and if it burns, it could ruin the taste of the oil. You will need to toss the oil out and start from scratch if this happens."
2034,Cook Kohlrabi,22,D,D4,Stir-fry the pieces for 5 to 7 minutes.,"Transfer the minced kohlrabi to the hot oil and garlic. Cook, stirring frequently, until it becomes tender-crisp.  Do not let the kohlrabi remain still for too long. If you do so, you may end up causing them to burn."
2035,Cook Kohlrabi,23,D,D5,Season and serve.,Season the kohlrabi with a dash of salt and stir well to coat evenly. Transfer the cooked kohlrabi onto individual serving platters and enjoy.
2036,Cook Kohlrabi,24,E,E1,Cut the kohlrabi.,"Use a sharp knife to cut the kohlrabi bulbs into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.  For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves. Use a sharp serrated knife to slice through the thick bulb more easily. A smooth knife is more likely to slip and, therefore, presents itself as more of a danger."
2037,Cook Kohlrabi,25,E,E2,Combine the kohlrabi and other ingredients.,"Put the kohlrabi, stock, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) butter, thyme, salt, and pepper in a large skillet. Place the skillet on the stove over medium-high heat and cover.  The skillet should be fairly deep and 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter. If you do not have a lid, you can cover the pan with a circle of parchment paper made to fit inside the mouth of the skillet."
2038,Cook Kohlrabi,26,E,E3,Braise for 15 minutes.,"Stir the kohlrabi occasionally as it cooks, and cook only until the kohlrabi is tender.  The kohlrabi needs to be tender enough to pierce with a fork, but it can still be a little on the crisp side."
2039,Cook Kohlrabi,27,E,E4,Add the remaining butter.,Remove the skillet from the heat and add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to it. Swirl the butter into the contents of the skillet until it melts.  Make sure that there are no visible swirls of butter left before you serve the kohlrabi. It should be thoroughly incorporated into the contents of the dish.
2040,Cook Kohlrabi,28,E,E5,Serve warm.,The kohlrabi is now ready to enjoy. You should serve it while still warm.
2041,Cook Kohlrabi,29,F,F1,Heat the oil in a skillet.,"Pour 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of cooking oil into a deep skillet and heat it on medium-high for a few minutes.  You will not need to completely immerse the kohlrabi fritters in oil, so you do not need enough oil to cover them completely. You do, however, need enough oil to completely cover the bottoms."
2042,Cook Kohlrabi,30,F,F2,Shred the kohlrabi.,"Use a box shredder to shred the kohlrabi bulbs into fine strands.  For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves."
2043,Cook Kohlrabi,31,F,F3,Add an egg and the flour.,"Transfer the shredded kohlrabi into a medium to large mixing bowl and add an egg. Mix well to coat evenly, then add the flour and mix well again.  The final result should be a thick mush that can be formed into patties or mounds."
2044,Cook Kohlrabi,32,F,F4,Cook the kohlrabi in small batches.,"Once the oil is hot enough, spoon out dollops of the kohlrabi mush into the oil.  Gently flatten each small mound with the back of your spatula to create a patty instead of a clump."
2045,Cook Kohlrabi,33,F,F5,Cook until crispy.,Cook the kohlrabi fritters for 2 to 4 minutes before flipping with your spatula. Cook the other side for another 2 to 4 minutes.
2046,Cook Kohlrabi,34,F,F6,Drain and serve.,Transfer the kohlrabi fritters onto a plate lined with clean paper towels. Give them 1 to 2 minutes to drain before dishing them onto individual serving platters.  You could also drain the fritters on brown paper bag instead of paper towels.
2047,Cook Mahi Mahi,0,A,A1,Get some Ti or banana leaves to wrap your mahi mahi.,"The Ti plant is a evergreen shrub native to Hawaii with smooth blade-shaped leaves measuring about four inches wide and range from one to two feet in length.You can also use banana leaves.   Wrapping your mahi mahi in leaves helps the fish steam slowly, keeping its juices as it cooks. If using frozen leaves, be sure to de-thaw them first.;"
2048,Cook Mahi Mahi,1,A,A2,Prepare your leaves.,"For Ti leaves, cut each leaf along the center of the rib and throw the rib away. Look for fresh Ti leaves at a Mexican or Asian market. For banana leaves, soak the leaf in water to soften it (about 1 to 2 minutes) and tear 12 long strips from 1 or 2 leaves and boil for 30 seconds before draining.   Cut 24 more strips, each about 12 inches by 3 inches and set them aside."
2049,Cook Mahi Mahi,2,A,A3,Cut your mahi mahi.,"Carefully slice your mahi mahi into 12 equal pieces (about 2 in. by 2 in).   If working with frozen filets, defrost them before cutting. Press lightly when cutting. The fish is delicate and you can easily crush the filets with too much pressure."
2050,Cook Mahi Mahi,3,A,A4,Chill your mahi mahi slices.,"Place your mahi mahi slices on a plate together and leave it in your refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.   You can drizzle lemon or lime juice, salt, pepper, fresh or dried herbs, or any seasonings you prefer onto the mahi mahi pieces while they chill."
2051,Cook Mahi Mahi,4,A,A5,Pack your mahi mahi.,Arrange two strips of Ti leaves or banana leaves on top of one another in a cross shape. Your piece of fish should fit in the center of the cross without overlaying.   You will use the sides of the leaves to wrap your piece of fish for steaming later. Top with grilled vegetables if you prefer.
2052,Cook Mahi Mahi,5,A,A6,Fold your leaves closed.,Begin with the lower strip and carefully fold the leaves over the filling by alternating strips in a cross shape. Use each new strip to fold the loose end of the previous strip over the filling.   Tuck the last strip beneath the packet. Tie closed with the thinner boiled strips you prepared earlier. Repeat for the rest of your mahi mahi pieces.
2053,Cook Mahi Mahi,6,A,A7,Set up your steamer.,Use a rack or steamer basket in a large pot with water until it rests just ½ inch below the top of the rack or basket.   Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
2054,Cook Mahi Mahi,7,A,A8,Cook your mahi mahi.,Carefully place your fish packets in a single layer on the rack or in the basket. Do not stack your packets.   Steam in batches if necessary. Cover the pot or rack and cook for 6-10 minutes (or until fish it barely opaque in the center). You may need to gently open one of your packets and cut to test.
2055,Cook Mahi Mahi,8,A,A9,Serve.,Gently remove your packets from the steamer and tip them slightly to drain any water than may have gathered inside. Serve hot or warm.   Serve with rice or lime wedges.
2057,Cook Mahi Mahi,10,B,B2,Cook your fillets.,"Use a metal spatula to gently place your fillets directly onto the oiled grill. Close the grill lid and cook for about 3 or 4 minutes.          Drizzle the fillets in a seasoning of your choice or marinate them prior to cooking. Try some olive oil, minced garlic, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt, lime juice, and grated lime zest or anything else you prefer."
2058,Cook Mahi Mahi,11,B,B3,Turn your fillets.,"After about 3 or 4 minutes, use a metal spatula to gently flip your fillets. Close the grill lid and cook for an additional 3 to 4 minutes or until the fish flakes easily."
2059,Cook Mahi Mahi,12,B,B4,Serve.,"Carefully remove your fillets from the grill and serve with fresh limes or zest. For best results, serve immediately."
2060,Cook Mahi Mahi,13,C,C1,Preheat the oven.,"For the best results, preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Before heating, center your oven racks."
2061,Cook Mahi Mahi,14,C,C2,Prepare your fish.,Gently rinse your fillets and place them on a non-stick baking pan or a pan lined with foil.   You can cook frozen fillets. Season your fish if you prefer. Squeeze lemon juice on each piece of fish and sprinkle them with garlic salt and pepper. Bread your fish if you prefer. Lightly dust each piece with a fine layer of breadcrumbs. You can make fresh breadcrumbs of use store-bought and mix in extra seasonings like garlic powder or pepper if you'd like.
2062,Cook Mahi Mahi,15,C,C3,Bake your fish.,"Place your pan in the oven and bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes. If you have breaded the fish, the breading should be golden brown.   Add 5-10 minutes if cooking from frozen."
2063,Cook Mahi Mahi,16,D,D1,Make a sauce.,"Try mixing cumin, garlic powder, dried oregano, ground ginger, smoked paprika, salt, and black and red peppers, or any other seasonings you prefer. Pour this over your mahi mahi before cooking with any of the methods, or let it soak in the fridge for about 10 minutes before cooking."
2064,Cook Mahi Mahi,17,D,D2,Prepare a fresh salsa.,"Try making a quick salsa of diced tomatoes, mango, jalapeno, red onion, cilantro, cumin, garlic and lime juice to enjoy with your cooked mahi mahi."
2065,Cook Mahi Mahi,18,D,D3,Experiment with seasonings.,"Here's the fun part. Because mahi mahi has such a light and delicate flavor, it is easy to influence the taste of the meat with any of your favorite seasonings. Lightly dust your mahi mahi with simple salt and pepper, or experiment with several dry seasonings and sauces for the ultimate mahi mahi."
2066,Cook Mahi Mahi,19,D,D4,Finished.,
2067,Braai Steak,0,none,1,Make the spice rub.,"Combine the salt, coriander, peppercorns, and thyme in a spice grinder or pestle and mortar. Grind the spices to a fine powder. Transfer the ground spices to a small bowl and add in the sugar, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.   Use a spoon or your finger to mix all the spices together until combined.;"
2068,Braai Steak,1,none,2,Season the steak.,Pour half the spice mix over the top of the steak and use your fingers to spread the spices around and massage them into the meat. Flip the steak over and repeat on the other side.   Transfer the steak to a plate and put it in the refrigerator to marinate in the spice mix for three to four hours.
2070,Braai Steak,3,none,4,Clean the grill.,"Use a wire brush to scrub the grill clean to remove old food particles that have been burned on. Once you’ve removed the larger pieces, go over each part of the grill with a grill brush and give the grill a good scrubbing. Empty out old ashes from the bottom of the bowl.When you're finished cleaning the grill, remove it from the braai and set it aside so you can light the fire."
2071,Braai Steak,4,none,5,Light the fire.,"Stuff the bottom of the chimney starter with a piece of newspaper. Fill the chimney starter with as much wood or charcoal as you can fit. A braai needs a good, hot, large fire, so you need to start with a lot of fuel.When the chimney starter is full, use a barbecue lighter to light the newspaper in the bottom of the starter. Light it in multiple places around the starter.   Once the fire is started, it will begin to spread and the charcoal or wood will burn down. Continue burning the fire in the chimney starter until the wood turns to embers or the charcoal turns gray."
2072,Braai Steak,5,none,6,Spread out the coals.,"When the wood or charcoal is ready, pour the embers into the bowl and spread them out evenly with charcoal tongs. This will ensure that there aren't any cool spots, and that the steak cooks evenly on the grill.   Concentrate the coals in the center of the bowl so the heat will be directly below where the steak is cooking."
2073,Braai Steak,6,none,7,Preheat the grill.,"Carefully place the grill back into the bowl of the barbecue. If your grill has multiple racks, place the grill on the lowest one, nearest to the fire. Let the grill sit over the coals for 10 to 20 minutes to preheat. This will ensure the steak starts cooking as soon as you lay it on the grill.   Ideally, you want the grill to be 2 to 6 inches (5 to 15 cm) from the bed of embers.When the grill is good and hot, use the wire brush again to give it a final scrub."
2074,Braai Steak,7,none,8,Cook the steak on each side.,"As soon as the grill is ready, use a pair of long-handled tongs to transfer the steak to the center of the grill. Don’t use a fork to move the steak around, or you'll pierce the meat and release the juices.   Cook the steak for three to five minutes on the first side. After three minutes, start checking the underside for browning. When the first side is brown, flip the steak with tongs and cook for another three to five minutes on the other side."
2075,Braai Steak,8,none,9,Cook the steak to medium rare.,"A braai steak is traditionally only cooked to medium rare. This will take about seven to 10 minutes in total. If you have a meat thermometer, the ideal temperature for the steak is 120 to 125 F (49 to 52 C).If you don’t have a meat thermometer, gently press the steak with your finger when you think it’s done. If the meat provides little resistance and gives easily to your push, then it’s ready."
2076,Braai Steak,9,none,10,Rest the meat.,"As soon as the meat is cooked, remove it from the grill with the tongs. Place the meat on a fresh plate or wooden board. Set the meat aside to rest for about 10 minutes.   Resting meat makes for a juicier steak because it prevents the juices from spilling out when the meat is cut."
2077,Braai Steak,10,none,11,Serve with roasted potatoes and asparagus.,"Steak and potatoes are a classic combination, and roasted potatoes are a great side dish for braai steak. Asparagus is also a fantastic pairing with steak, and grilled asparagus nicely complements a braai steak."
2078,Cook Flounder,0,A,A1,Make a marinade for flounder fillets.,"Mix together the following ingredients into a medium-sized bowl: 1 egg white, 2 tablespoons (.03 L) skim milk, 1 tablespoon (.01 L) garlic powder and 1 tablespoon (.01 L) soy sauce. Drop your flounder fillets into the bowl and turn to coat evenly. Place the bowl in fridge for about 15 minutes after covering with foil or plastic wrap.;"
2079,Cook Flounder,1,A,A2,Prepare a coating mixture for your flounder.,"Combine 1/3 cup (.08 L) store-bought breadcrumbs and 1/4 cup (.06 L) Parmesan cheese in a gallon-sized plastic bag. Fresh breadcrumbs will not work because they are not dry enough. You can use dry or freshly grated Parmesan, depending on your personal taste."
2080,Cook Flounder,2,A,A3,Transfer fillets from the bowl to the bag.,Seal the bag so you can lightly shake it to coat the flounder in the breadcrumb mixture.
2081,Cook Flounder,3,A,A4,Use medium heat to warm oil in a skillet.,
2082,Cook Flounder,4,A,A5,Fry fillets one at a time for 4 to 5 minutes per side.,The flounders should be a golden brown.
2083,Cook Flounder,5,B,B1,Preheat oven to 350 F (176.67 C).,
2085,Cook Flounder,7,B,B3,"Dust fillets with pepper, salt and garlic powder to taste.",
2086,Cook Flounder,8,B,B4,Coat a baking pan with non-stick spray and add the fish.,"If you don't coat the baking pan, your fillets will stick and fall apart when you try to remove them from the pan."
2087,Cook Flounder,9,B,B5,Bake fillets for 7 minutes or until the fish is white all the way through.,
2088,Cook Flounder,10,C,C1,Prepare charcoal at least 25 - 30 minutes before cooking.,You should spread white coals into a single layer before you begin grilling.
2089,Cook Flounder,11,C,C2,Wash flounder under cool running water and pat dry.,
2090,Cook Flounder,12,C,C3,"Combine 1/2 cup (.12 L) olive oil, 1/4 cup (.06 L) lemon juice, 1 teaspoon (4.93 mL) Worcestershire sauce and 1 teaspoon (4.93 mL) salt in a small bowl.",You'll apply this mixture to the fillets while grilling.
2091,Cook Flounder,13,C,C4,Grill fish for at least 6 minutes on each side.,Brush fish with sauce mixture during the entire grilling process.
2092,Cook Flounder,14,C,C5,Check to ensure the fillets are ready.,"They should be soft, flaky and white all the way through."
2093,Cook Flounder,15,D,D1,Preheat the broiler.,
2095,Cook Flounder,17,D,D3,Place fillets on a baking sheet and dust with pepper.,
2096,Cook Flounder,18,D,D4,Brush 1 tablespoon (.01 L) olive oil over the flounder fillets.,"You may lightly coat with mustard, sour cream or mayonnaise if you wish."
2097,Cook Flounder,19,D,D5,Put the baking sheet about 3 inches (.08 m) below the broiler for approximately 2 minutes.,
2098,Cook Flounder,20,D,D6,Test the fillets to see whether they are ready to eat.,They should be white all the way through.
2099,Clean Flounder,0,none,1,Remove the fish slime.,"Place the flounder on a clean, flat surface. Healthy flounder will be covered with a light film of transparent slime. Rinse the slime off the fish with lightly running cool water.;"
2100,Clean Flounder,1,none,2,Cut the gills.,"With a small, sharp knife, cut across the fish, through the skin, behind the gills. The knife should reach the bones of the fish, but not cut through them."
2101,Clean Flounder,2,none,3,Cut down the side of the flounder.,"Find the flounder backbone, which runs down the middle of the fish from the gills to the tail. Cut along this line, from the center of the gills to the tail. Follow the backbone while cutting."
2102,Clean Flounder,3,none,4,Fillet the flounder.,"Insert the tip of the knife under the skin, along the backbone. Slice from the gill to the tail, lifting the side of the fish that is coming loose. Keep lifting the fillet as it pulls away from the bone. Continuing cutting until the fillet is separated from the backbone. The flesh should remain attached at the tail."
2103,Clean Flounder,4,none,5,Cut the bottom side of the flounder.,"Once the top part of the fish has been filleted, make the same incisions under the flesh and next to the backbone, to pull the bottom part of the fish from the bones. Keep the fillets attached to the fish near the tail."
2104,Clean Flounder,5,none,6,Remove the skin.,"Slide the knife between the skin and the meat of the fish and gently cut the flesh away from the skin. Hold onto the skin instead of the flesh during this process, as the skin is stronger."
2105,Clean Flounder,6,none,7,Flip the fish over.,Perform the same steps of cutting and filleting on the other side of the fish.
2106,Clean Flounder,7,none,8,Remove the flounder fillets.,"Once separated from the bone and the skin, the flounder has been cleaned and is ready for cooking and preparing. Four fillets should be taken from one average flounder."
2107,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,0,A,A1,Quarter a whole chicken and squeeze fresh lime juice over it all.,"You can buy the chicken pre-quartered, or you can do it yourself easily with a sharp knife and some kitchen shears. You'll end up with four pieces -- two thighs and two breasts.To do so:   Pull the thighs away from the breast and cut them away at the joint. Use the scissors to cut the breastbone off the chicken. Flip the chicken back over, breast up. Cut lengthwise through the chicken, splitting the breast in two.Squeeze fresh lime juice on the chicken quarters.;"
2108,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,1,A,A2,"Chop 2 Scotch Bonnet peppers, a bushel of green onions, and one small yellow onion into large chunks.","These vegetables will go into a food processor later, so don't worry about getting them too fine right now. You just want them to fit and chop easily in the processor.   If you're a fan of garlic, chop up 2-3 cloves as well and throw them in. Habaneros and Jalapenos will both do as substitutes in a pinch."
2109,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,2,A,A3,"Combine the following wet ingredients in a bowl, then transfer to your food processor.","The wet ingredients are easiest to measure out first, stirred together, and then tossed in with food processor with the peppers and onions.   1/3 cup olive oil 1/3 cup distilled white vinegar 1/2 cup orange juice 1/2 cup lime juice 1/2 cup molasses 1/4 cup soy sauce"
2110,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,3,A,A4,"Add the following spices, sugars, and dry ingredients to the food processor and blend until almost liquid.","There should still be some chunks here and there, but you want this marinade to be more or less liquid. This is your jerk sauce!   1 tablespoon ground thyme (or 2-3 springs fresh thyme) 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg + 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1 tablespoon allspice (or 7-8 whole allspice) 1-2 Bay leaves 1/4 cup cilantro (optional)"
2111,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,4,A,A5,"Cover the entire chicken in the jerk sauce and marinate overnight, covered, in the fridge.","Yo should marinate the bird for at least 4 hours, though most chefs swear that it needs to be overnight. The acids and salt in the marinade liquids will tenderize the meat and lend more flavor to the meat."
2112,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,5,A,A6,Heat up an outdoor grill to approximately 350F.,"If this is a charcoal grill, it will take about 30-40 minutes to heat up, though a propane grill will be at heat within 10 minutes. If you don't have thermometer on your grill, the right heat is roughly when you can't hold your hand over the grill (6"" away) for more than 3-4 seconds."
2113,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,6,A,A7,"Cook for approximately 1 hour in the oven or on the barbecue until done, Flipping every 7-8 minutes.","The chicken should be cooked to 160F degrees all the way through, with a crispy skin crossed with grill marks. Every 2-3 times you flip the bird, baste it with a little bit more jerk marinade."
2114,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,7,A,A8,"Remove chicken from oven or grill and serve, after it has rested for 5 minutes.","As meat cooks, the juices that keep it tender are released into the meat. If you cut the meat while it is still piping hot, these juices leak out and lead to dry, rough meat. But if you simply wait 5 minutes or so, the juices will reabsorb into the chicken, leading to a much more delicious bird."
2115,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,8,B,B1,"Rinse off and quarter a 3-4 lb chicken, leaving the skin on.","Remove the chicken from the fridge, rinse it off and pat it dry, then get your sharpest knife out. You can buy chicken quarters pre-cut at many stores, but it is cheaper and fresher to quarter the chicken yourself. To do so, start with the chicken breast-side up, then:   Pull the thighs away from the breasts and cut them off at the joint. Flip the chicken over and, using a pair of kitchen sheers, cut the backbone out of the chicken. Flip the chicken back over and cut the breast in half lengthwise, slicing through the ribcage."
2117,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,10,B,B3,Roughly chop up 1-2 Scotch Bonnet peppers and 1 bunch of green onions.,"You can substitute in jalapenos if you need. Don't worry about getting them too fine, as everything will get blended up finely in a food processor later. You're just cutting it up now to make sure everything fits."
2118,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,11,B,B4,"Toss 3 tablespoons seasoning salt, 2-3 sprigs fresh thyme, and a pinch of black pepper in the food processor with the peppers, onions, and allspice.","If you'd like to take this rub a little further, you can also toss in the following spices, choosing your favorites:   2-3 cloves chopped garlic 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons dark brown sugar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and nutmeg"
2119,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,12,B,B5,Add 1/2 cup of water to the food processor and blend until there are only light chunks.,"You want a spreadable, but still not entirely wet, marinade -- a bit like wet, chunky sand. Use the ""pulse"" setting to chop it up to your desired consistency. This is your jerk marinade!"
2120,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,13,B,B6,"Alternatively, hand mash all the ingredients into a paste using a mortar and pestal.","If you don't have a food processor, you should do things the old fashioned way -- crushing by hand. You'll want to chop the peppers and green onions as finely as possible first, then start crushing it bit by bit, adding more once you have the first handful or so crushed into a nice, chunky paste."
2121,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,14,B,B7,Spread half off the jerk marinade under the skin of the chicken.,"Lift the skin up slightly and slide your marinade underneath, spreading it across the whole chicken. Make sure you don't pull the skin off of the chicken -- you just want to lift the skin enough to get the marinade underneath."
2122,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,15,B,B8,"Spread half of the remaining marinade on top of the chicken, saving the rest for basting.","If you're running out of marinade, you can just use some salt and pepper, saving the rest for basting or a dipping sauce. Make sure you keep a few tablespoons of marinade to drop on the chicken as it cooks."
2124,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,17,B,B10,"Heat the oven to 350 and cook the chicken for 1 hour, flipping halfway through.","Start the chicken meat sides up, basting the quarters with the leftover jerk marinade and flipping after 30 minutes. You want the internal temperature of the chicken to reach 160F. If you stick a thick through with a skewer, the juice that runs out should be clear.   If you want extra crispy skin, finish the chicken breast-side up on broil for 5-7 minutes. You can cook this chicken on the grill ass well"
2125,Cook Jamaican Jerk Chicken,18,B,B11,"Serve hot, with rice and beans and a splash of fresh lime juice.","If you have any leftover jerk marinade you can pour it over the cooked chicken or set it aside as a dipping sauce. Once the chicken is done, let it sit for 5 minutes before cutting into it, then serve hot."

2213,Cook Glass Gem Corn,3,A,A4,Dehydrate the corn until crispy.,"The dehydrator should be set to 120 degrees Fahrenheit (about 49 degrees Celsius). Dehydrate your kernels until they're hard and crispy. How long this will take depends on how many kernels you're dehydrating, but it can take between 12 and 14 hours. Check on the kernels every hour or so and remove them when they're done."
2215,Cook Glass Gem Corn,5,B,B1,Place your kernels in a blender.,"As glass gem corn is a flint corn, you can use it to make cornmeal which can be used in meals likes grits.Use the strongest blender you have, as this will make the finest cornmeal. Add as many kernels as you want to your blender. It depends on how much cornmeal you want to make. More kernels will produce a greater amount of cornmeal.If you don't have a very strong blender, you may be unable to grind kernels fine enough for cornmeal. Consider splurging on a stronger blender if you want to make cornmeal with your glass gem corn."
2216,Cook Glass Gem Corn,6,B,B2,"Grind the kernels, increasing the speed gradually.","Start at the lowest speed possible. After a few seconds, increase the speed to a medium level. After a few more seconds, increase the speed to high. Increasing the speed gradually will prevent kernels from clogging the blades."

2241,Clarify Butter,16,D,D5,Transfer it into a separate container.,"Repeat until all the clarified butter is extracted, leaving the solids behind."
2242,Cook Beef Tongue,0,A,A1,Purchase the tongue.,"Larger tongues can take much longer to cook, so choose the smallest tongue you can find, ideally below 3 pounds / 1.4 kg. Tongue has a short shelf life, so purchase it very fresh or frozen from a reliable butcher. (If frozen, thaw in the refrigerator for maximum safety.)   Some tongues include the glands, bones, and fat at the root of the tongue. This area is edible when cooked, but not everyone likes the soft, fatty texture.You may cut it off at home (before or after cooking), or look for a pre-trimmed ""Swiss cut"" tongue.Brined tongue packs extra flavor and can be prepared the same way as fresh tongue.;"
2243,Cook Beef Tongue,1,A,A2,Clean the tongue.,"Place the tongue in a clean sink and scrub thoroughly under cold running water. Clean until the surface is free of dirt and blood.   Many recipes recommend soaking the tongue in cold water for an hour or two, changing the water whenever it becomes murky. Store-bought tongue is usually clean enough to skip this step, but it can freshen up the tongue's flavor."
2244,Cook Beef Tongue,2,A,A3,Prepare the broth.,"Fill a large pot with chick or beef stock, or moderately salted water. Add vegetables and herbs of your choice. An onion or two, a couple bay leaves, peppercorns, and a carrot form a good simple base. Feel free to add other ingredients, such as oregano, rosemary, garlic, or chiles. Bring to a boil over high heat.   Use a pressure cooker or slow cooker to speed up the process. If you want to create a thicker sauce to serve with the tongue, add four cans of condensed French onion soup."
2245,Cook Beef Tongue,3,A,A4,Add the tongue.,"Add the tongue to the broth and cover the pot. Bring to a boil again, then reduce to a simmer.   Keep the tongue completely submerged. You may need to add more water or weigh it down with a steamer basket."
2246,Cook Beef Tongue,4,A,A5,Simmer until tender.,"The tongue is ready when it turns white and a knife easily pierces the thickest part. This typically takes about 50–60 minutes per pound (0.45 kg) of meat.Fast cooking or undercooking makes the tongue tough and unpleasant. If you've got the time, err on the side of caution and keep simmering for an extra hour or two. If using a pressure cooker, heat until it starts to steam. Reduce to medium heat and cook for 10–15 minutes per pound (0.45 kg). Let cool until steam releases on its own."
2247,Cook Beef Tongue,5,A,A6,Peel the tongue while warm.,"Transfer the tongue onto a plate with a pair of tongs. Wait until the tongue is just cool enough to touch, then cut through the outer white layer lengthwise with a sharp knife. Peel off this layer with your fingers, cutting when necessary. (This layer is technically edible, but has an unpleasant taste and texture.)   The tongue becomes much harder to peel once cooled. If it's already cooled to room temperature, though, it can help to submerge it in ice water. Save the broth to make a soup or flavor sauces."
2248,Cook Beef Tongue,6,A,A7,Cut the meat into 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) slices.,"Cut diagonal slices with a sharp knife to serve with salsa verde, on a sandwich with brown mustard and greens, or baked for another half hour with roast potatoes. There's plenty of meat there, so consider saving some larger pieces to grill or try with the other recipes below.   If the meat is tough, it's undercooked. Return it to the broth and keep simmering. You can easily turn a portion of the sauce into gravy by adding flour."
2249,Cook Beef Tongue,7,A,A8,Store leftovers in the fridge.,Boiled tongue will keep for about five days in an airtight container in the fridge.
2250,Cook Beef Tongue,8,B,B1,Clean and simmer the tongue.,"Tongue needs a long, slow cooking process to become tender. Refer to the simmered recipe above for instructions on cleaning, then simmer in hot, salted water for at least 1 hour per pound of meat (0.45 kg).   For extra flavor, add onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, and/or your favorite chiles. Check on it every hour or so. You may need to add water to keep the tongue submerged."
2252,Cook Beef Tongue,10,B,B3,Peel and slice the tongue.,"Once a knife can pierce through the thickest part of the tongue, remove it from the water with kitchen tongs. Once cool enough to handle — but still quite warm — cut through the white outer layer and peel off with your fingers. Slice into rough ½ inch (1.25 cm) slices for your tacos."
2253,Cook Beef Tongue,11,B,B4,Fry or grill until crisp.,"Tongue is a fatty meat, and tastes delicious when it develops a crisp outer layer. Add a generous amount of oil or lard to a pan, about 3 tbsp (45 mL) for six slices, and heat until it shimmers. Add the tongue and fry until brown and crisp on all sides, flipping occasionally.If you're using a grill instead, brush the slices generously with olive oil and heat on a 425ºF (220ºC) grill for about 10–15 minutes, flipping once. For a healthier options, just brown lightly in a small amount of oil, then simmer in the salsa verde for a few minutes."

2255,Cook Beef Tongue,13,C,C1,Clean and simmer the tongue.,"Clean as described in the basic simmer recipe. Place the tongue in a pot of hot water along with 1 of the onions, 2 carrots, 1 stick celery, and 1 clove garlic. Simmer the tongue for about one hour per pound (0.45 kg), until a knife can pierce the thickest part.   Coarsely chop all vegetables, remove leaves from the celery, and crush the garlic. This is similar to the basic simmer preparation described above, which is how most tongue recipes begin. Refer to that method for more detail if you have any questions."
2256,Cook Beef Tongue,14,C,C2,Peel the tongue.,"Remove the tongue with a pair of tongs. Peel off the white layer as soon as the meat is cool enough to touch. While warm, this should come off easily after a few incisions with a sharp knife."
2257,Cook Beef Tongue,15,C,C3,"Sauté raisins, almonds, and the remaining onion.",Melt 2 tbsp (30 mL) butter in a pan. Chop and add the other onion along with ⅓ cup (80mL) raisins and 3 tbsp (45mL) chopped almonds. Heat while stirring occasionally.

2261,Clean Chicken Gizzards,0,none,1,Start with a quality chicken and/or gizzards.,"You can either raise your own chickens for slaughter or purchase your chicken products at a grocery store or local butcher shop. They are also sometimes available at farmer’s markets. It’s even possible to order gizzards online via various grocery delivery programs, including some on Amazon."
2262,Clean Chicken Gizzards,1,none,2,Prepare your workspace.,"Wipe down your countertop, butcher block, or cutting board with a clean, wet towel. Locating your workspace near a sink is a good idea as it makes it easier to wash your hands and rinse off items as needed."
2263,Clean Chicken Gizzards,2,none,3,Select the proper tools.,"Many people believe that it is a good idea to use your sharpest knives to butcher a chicken and to clean out a gizzard. Others argue that the grit within the gizzard can damage sharp knives and that only dull ones should be used. It is your choice as to what you select, but be aware that it may be more difficult to remove the thin membrane with a dull knife.If you choose to use a chopping board, make sure that it is one that is heavy and won’t move while you are cutting into the gizzard. Plastic cutting boards are usually more sanitary than wood ones, but they have a tendency to be lighter and move more."
2264,Clean Chicken Gizzards,3,none,4,Clean your utensils and hands.,"Rinse off your knives with soap and water before placing them on your work area. As a last step, keep the water on warm and lather your hands up with soap. Rinse your hands under the water until they are completely clean. Dry them with a fresh towel.If you choose to wear gloves, make sure that they are well-fitting. Gloves that are too loose can make it more difficult to hold on to the gizzard."
2265,Clean Chicken Gizzards,4,none,5,Thaw the chicken.,"If you bought a whole chicken frozen, place it in the refrigerator until it is fully thawed. It should take 24 hours of fridge thawing time per five pounds of meat. It is also possible to thaw the gizzards by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and then submerging them in a sink filled with cold water. Drain and refill the sink with cold water every 30 minutes until the gizzards are thawed. Estimate 30-60 minutes of thawing time per pound using the cold water method.If you thaw your gizzards in the sink, make sure that the plastic bag stays sealed to prevent the spread of potentially dangerous bacteria or germs. Wipe down the sink with an antibacterial cleaner after use."
2266,Clean Chicken Gizzards,5,none,6,Remove the giblet package.,"If you bought a chicken whole, after it is defrosted, you’ll want to reach inside the cavity and remove the plastic giblet package. This package will contain the neck, kidneys, heart, and gizzards. Pull out the gizzards to use."
2267,Clean Chicken Gizzards,6,none,7,Locate the gizzards inside the bird.,"If you are butchering a fresh chicken, then you will want to look for the gizzard at the end of the intestines. It will almost look like a second stomach. Reach your hand into the interior cavity and gently lift the gizzards out, taking some of the intestine with you if necessary. Just make sure to keep the intestines intact or you could risk polluting the meat and gizzard."
2268,Clean Chicken Gizzards,7,none,8,Place the gizzards on the cutting board.,"Go slowly and be very careful as they can be a bit slippery. If the gizzards are covered in blood or debris, then rinse them with water before setting them down."
2269,Clean Chicken Gizzards,8,none,9,Cut the gizzard in half lengthwise.,"Hold the gizzard down firmly, but not enough to change the overall shape. Take your knife and cut the gizzard in half, slicing all the way through until you have two separate pieces. It is best to make just one smooth cut per gizzard."
2270,Clean Chicken Gizzards,9,none,10,Wash out the interior of the gizzard under water.,"Once you make the incision, you will see a variety of debris inside the gizzard. Rinse out the inside of the gizzard, moving the water stream around in order to clean out all of the debris. It may take you several minutes to complete this process. Keep going until the flesh looks totally clean.This cleaning process is very important because the gizzard is a part of a chicken’s digestive system and can have matter inside that is not safe for human consumption."
2271,Clean Chicken Gizzards,10,none,11,Use your fingers to find any extra sediment.,"As you hold the gizzard under water, it might be helpful to use your fingers to rub against the flesh of the interior to loosen any stubborn debris. Keep gently scrubbing until you feel that everything is smooth.Be aware that the inside of a gizzard can appear to be brown or black due to the presence of sediment. This is a natural and not a cause for a concern if the gizzard is properly rinsed. The debris can sometimes be rather larger and include pieces of rock and grass."
2272,Clean Chicken Gizzards,11,none,12,Trim the lining away.,"When the interior of the gizzard is clean, you will see a yellow-tinted lining in the inside. Remove the lining by peeling it away from the rest of the gizzard’s flesh. It should come off fairly easily, but you may need to make a slight cut at the side of the gizzard to start the separation process.The lining can be differentiated from the edible flesh because it will feel rubbery in texture."
2273,Clean Chicken Gizzards,12,none,13,Dry the gizzards.,"When the lining has been removed and discarded, rinse the gizzards again with water. Then, place them on a fresh cutting board, patting them dry with paper towels. Keep going until there is very little moisture visible on the skin of the gizzard."
2274,Clean Chicken Gizzards,13,none,14,Store them in a sealed container.,Place the cleaned gizzards in a container until you are ready to cook them. Make sure that the container is tightly sealed and is clean on the inside to avoid cross-contamination.
2275,Clean Chicken Gizzards,14,none,15,"Wash all utensils, the workspace, and your hands.","Go through and wash all of your knives and cutting boards under warm water and soap or place them in the dishwasher under the sanitize function. When everything else is clean and wiped down, go ahead and do a final hand wash.Don’t forget to wipe down the counter space with a cleaner."
2276,Clean Chicken Gizzards,15,none,16,Cook the gizzards.,"You can prepare gizzards in a variety of ways, including boiling, baking, frying, or simmering. Experiment with different methods until you find one that you prefer. Many people place the gizzards in brine for at least a few hours before cooking in order to improve the texture. Look for a great brine recipe online and then adapt it to suit your personal tastes."

2297,"Brine, Truss, and Roast a Turkey",0,none,1,Ensure that you have an ample oven.,"Turkeys are large birds-usually between 12 and 22 pounds. You should have an oven that allows hot air to circulate the bird at all angles. Be sure your bird has at least 6 inches (15.2 cm) of clear space from skin to oven wall so that it will cook evenly. If your oven is small, try using a breast of turkey or a whole chicken instead.;"
2298,"Brine, Truss, and Roast a Turkey",1,none,2,Get a roasting pan.,"Any roasting pan will do, as long as it's large enough to allow 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) of space between the pan edge and the turkey, and the bird is suspended above the bottom of the pan. Use a roasting rack, and if you don't have one, improvise. Create a crosshatch of carrots and celery. If you do this, though, it may be trickier to flip the bird during the cooking process."
2299,"Brine, Truss, and Roast a Turkey",2,none,3,Brine the bird.,"Brining involves soaking the turkey in a salt water bath. It makes crispier skin and more flavorful meat.   Put cold water in a large container. 2 gallons (7.6 L) is sufficient for most birds, but if your bird is bigger than 18 pounds, you may need more. Add 1 cup of salt per gallon to the container. The size of your turkey doesn't influence the amount of salt used. PLEASE NOTE: unless you want a really salty bird, do not brine a kosher or self-basting turkey. They already contain a lot of sodium. Dunk your turkey into the brine solution and put the container in the refrigerator. Allow the bird to soak in the brine for 4 to 6 hours. The bigger the bird, the longer it should soak. Remove the bird from the brine and rinse it well under cold water. Pat dry with paper towels."
2300,"Brine, Truss, and Roast a Turkey",3,none,4,Truss (or tie up) your bird.,"If you are going to stuff your turkey, do it just before you truss it. If you would rather cook the stuffing separately, try stuffing the cavity loosely with garlic cloves, fresh thyme, carrots, and celery, after salting and peppering it thoroughly. Tuck the tips of the drumsticks into the skin at the tail to secure and tuck the wing tips behind the back. Thread cotton twine through the eye of a trussing needle and sew up the cavity with a few stitches. Only a few-any more and you run the risk of your bird cooking unevenly."
2301,"Brine, Truss, and Roast a Turkey",4,none,5,Roast your bird.,"Adjust the oven rack to the lowest position and preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C), or 425 degrees for a turkey larger than 18 pounds. Melt 1/4 cup butter in a saucepan, then brush the butter to cover the surface of the turkey. Grind a lot of cracked black pepper over the bird. Put the turkey breast side down on the roasting rack and roast for 45 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the bird. Remove the pan from the oven and reduce the temperature to 325 °F (163 °C). Use clean potholders or kitchen towels to rotate the turkey breast side up and baste the entire surface with pan drippings. Continue to roast, basting every 20 minutes, until the thickest part of the breast registers 165 °F (74 °C) and the thickest part of the thigh registers 170 to 175 °F (77 to 79 °C) on an instant-read thermometer.

2305,Cook Bacon in the Toaster Oven,2,none,3,Place a sheet pan under the wire tray in your toaster oven.,"You should find a sheet pan that fits on the bottom of your toaster oven. If any bacon drips during the cooking process, a sheet pan will catch this. It is easier to remove the pan and clean it than clean the bottom of a toaster oven."
2306,Cook Bacon in the Toaster Oven,3,none,4,"Set the toaster oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (205 degrees Celsius).If you're not sure how to set the temperature on your toaster oven, refer to the instructions manual.","Allow the toaster oven to heat completely before adding your bacon.

2312,Cook Chuck Steak,0,A,A1,Preheat the oven and season the steak.,Turn the oven on to 325 degrees F (162 C). Place 2 tablespoons of vegetable or canola oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Heat the oil over medium heat and sprinkle the chuck steak with salt and pepper.   You could use a big skillet if your chuck steaks are thin.;
2313,Cook Chuck Steak,1,A,A2,Sear the chuck steak.,"Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the seasoned steak to the Dutch oven. The steak will sizzle as soon as you add it to the pot. Let the steak cook on medium heat until it browns. Use tongs to turn the steak so that it browns on all sides. Use the tongs to take the steaks out of the pot once they're seared. Pour off and discard any fat from the pan.Wear oven mitts when searing the steak since the hot oil may sputter."
2314,Cook Chuck Steak,2,A,A3,Add a liquid.,"Pour in about 3/4 of a cup of liquid. This will keep the chuck steak moist as it cooks and will make it even more tender. Try using one of the following as braising liquids:Beef or vegetable broth Apple juice or cider Cranberry juice Tomato juice Dry wine mixed with broth Water 1 tablespoon of a liquid seasoning like barbecue sauce, Dijon mustard, soy sauce, steak sauce or Worcestershire sauce (You can add these to water to dilute them.)"
2315,Cook Chuck Steak,3,A,A4,Stir in dry seasonings.,"To add even more flavor to your braised chuck steak, stir in dried herbs of your choice. You'll need to stir in about 1 teaspoon of dried herbs or 1 tablespoon of fresh herbs. You can use herbs like:   Basil Herbes de Provence Italian seasoning Oregano Thyme"
2316,Cook Chuck Steak,4,A,A5,Braise the steak in the oven.,"Cover the Dutch oven with a heavy lid and place the steak in the oven. For 2 1/2 to 3 pounds of chuck steak, bake the steak for 1 hour and 15 minutes to 1 hour and 45 minutes. The chuck steak will be completely tender when it's finished braising and ready to serve. If you check the temperature, the steak should be between 145 degrees F (62 C) for medium-rare and 175 F (79 C) for well-done.To check tenderness, insert a fork or knife into the steak. If tender, the fork or knife should slide in easily."
2317,Cook Chuck Steak,5,B,B1,Turn on the broiler and season the steak.,"If your broiler is in the top part of the oven, move the oven rack about 4 inches away from the broiler element. If the broiler is in a sliding tray under the oven, you won't need to adjust the rack. Turn the broiler on while you salt and pepper both sides of your chuck steak.If you like, you can use any steak seasoning to flavor the chuck steak."
2318,Cook Chuck Steak,6,B,B2,Broil one side of the steak.,"Place the seasoned steak onto a baking sheet or skillet and place it below the broiler. Depending on the thickness of the steak, broil it for 7 to 9 minutes. If you'd like it on the medium or rare side, cook it closer to 6 or 7 minutes.Depending on the type of broiler you have, you may want to leave your oven door cracked so you can monitor the cooking."
2319,Cook Chuck Steak,7,B,B3,Turn and broil the other side of the steak.,"Use a sharp fork or kitchen tongs to carefully turn the chuck steak. Place the steak back under the broiler and let it cook for another 5 to 8 minutes, depending on thickness. Check the steak's temperature.If you want a medium-rare steak, remove it from the broiler at 145 degrees F (60 C). For a medium steak, let it cook to 160 degrees F (70 C)."
2320,Cook Chuck Steak,8,B,B4,Let the steak rest and serve it.,Remove the steak to a cutting board or serving plate. Place aluminum foil over the steak so it forms a tent and let the steak rest for about 5 minutes. This will help the muscle tissue in the steak redistribute the juice so it doesn't all run out when you begin cutting the steak.The steak should cool down about 5 degrees from the time you take it out from the broiler and after it's rested.
2321,Cook Chuck Steak,9,C,C1,Turn on the oven and season your steak.,"Preheat your oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Season your steak with any kind of seasoning you like. If you want to keep it simple, just use coarse salt and pepper. Don't be afraid to coat both sides of your steak with the seasoning since this will give it flavor and help it brown. You should be able to see seasoning on the steak. You could also use:Cajun seasoning Chimichurri Teriyaki Montreal steak seasoning"
2322,Cook Chuck Steak,10,C,C2,Heat a skillet.,"Place a heavy bottomed skillet (preferably a cast iron skillet) over high heat. Add a few tablespoons of coconut oil, grapeseed oil, or vegetable oil in the pan to heat. You want the pan to get really hot so the steak sizzles immediately and begins to brown.   Coconut, grapeseed, and vegetable oils all have high-smoke points so they won't burn as your pan heats up. Avoid pan-frying a steak in butter or olive oil which will burn."
2323,Cook Chuck Steak,11,C,C3,Sear both sides of the steak.,"Place the steak in your hot oiled skillet and let it cook for 1 to 3 minutes. Carefully turn the steak and sear the other side for another 1 to 3 minutes. The steak should be a dark golden brown color on the sides. It will still be mostly raw inside, but you'll finish the steak in the oven for even cooking.   You can turn the steaks frequently while they're searing so they sear evenly and brown faster."
2324,Cook Chuck Steak,12,C,C4,Finish cooking the steak in the oven.,"Place the entire skillet with the seared steak into the preheated oven. Cook the steak for 6 to 8 minutes or until the steak reaches the level of doneness you'd like. If you check the temperature, the steak should be between 145 degrees F (62 C) for medium-rare and 175 F (79 C) for well-done. Transfer the steak to a plate and let it rest a few minutes before you serve it.Letting the steak rest helps the juices in the meat distribute evenly. Ensure your skillet is ovenproof before placing it the oven. Even if it says it's ovenproof, check to see if it can be used in a 400 degree F oven."

Sometimes bags of dried beans can have small rocks and other inedible debris mixed in.Remove any suspicious looking beans as well. Old, wrinkled beans won’t soften well and may hurt your teeth.;"
2352,Cook Mung Beans,1,A,A2,Bring some water to a boil.,Place a large cooking pot on the stove over high heat. Add about three cups (.7 liters) of fresh water to the pot and let it come to a boil.   Always cook with cold tap water. Hot tap water can dissolve contaminants in pipe systems that will be carried into your food.
2353,Cook Mung Beans,2,A,A3,Add the dried beans.,"Add one cup (200 grams) of dried mung beans to the boiling water. Give the beans a good stir to help saturate them completely. Don’t worry if a few beans float on the top. As soon as these beans soak up enough water, they will sink to the bottom.   If want to cook more than one cup of beans, use more water. For every cup of beans, you should boil three cups of water. One cup of dried mung beans will yield three cups of cooked beans, or approximately three servings."
2354,Cook Mung Beans,3,A,A4,Simmer the beans for 30-40 minutes.,"After adding the beans, allow the water to return to a boil. Next, lower the heat to medium low. Let the soup simmer for 45 minutes to an hour or until the beans are soft.To check if the beans are ready, remove a small spoonful and allow it to cool before tasting it.   A simmering pot will release a few small streams of bubbles. If the surface of the liquid is bubbling too much, reduce the heat.Resist the urge to add salt until the beans are done cooking. If you add salt while the beans are still simmering, they may become tough."
2355,Cook Mung Beans,4,A,A5,Season the beans and serve.,"You can blend the soft beans to serve them as a hearty stew, drain them to create a healthy side dish, or add them to your favorite savory recipe.

For example, if you’re not sure if a bean is too old to eat or not, play it safe and discard it."
2357,Cook Mung Beans,6,B,B2,Add cooking liquid.,"For every cup (200 grams) of beans, you will need about three cups (.7 liters) of liquid. You can use fresh water, vegetable broth, or meat broth. However, make sure not to overfill the slow cooker.   Most slow cookers have a “fill” line on the inside. Otherwise, only fill the slow cooker halfway full."
2358,Cook Mung Beans,7,B,B3,Add seasonings to the slow cooker.,"Sprinkle in seasonings such as onion, garlic, or bay leaves. However, wait to add the salt until the beans are cooked to avoid tough beans.Other delicious seasonings include:   Butter Curry powder Shallots Ginger"
2359,Cook Mung Beans,8,B,B4,Cook the beans.,"Place the lid on your slow cooker and turn it on. You can use the “low” setting to cook the beans for 6.5 hours, creating a creamy, soup-like texture. Alternatively, cook the beans on “high” for 3 hours to create a thinner bean dish.After one hour, sample the beans periodically to check for doneness. The beans will be done when they’re soft and flavorful."
2360,Cook Mung Beans,9,B,B5,Season and serve.,"Salt and pepper the cooked beans to taste. After seasoning, serve the beans immediately. You can add extra cooking liquid to create a vegetable soup, on a bed of rice, or by themselves as a healthy side dish.   Leftover beans can be kept in the refrigerator for up to five days."
2361,Cook Mung Beans,10,C,C1,Pour the dry mung beans into a large bowl.,"Pour the beans very slowly, examining each bean. This will allow you to identify any rocks or other small debris that got caught in the beans.If a bean looks suspicious, play it safe and take it out."
2362,Cook Mung Beans,11,C,C2,Pour water over the beans.,"Measure out two or three cups (.5-.7 liters) of water for every cup (200 grams) of beans.Next, pour the water over the beans. Don’t worry about any beans that float to the top. They will sink as soon as they soak up enough water.   Cover the bowl with a lid or wrap it in plastic wrap to protect the beans from debris."
2363,Cook Mung Beans,12,C,C3,Soak the beans for twenty four hours.,"Store the bowl of mung beans in a cool, dark place for at least twenty four hours.This will allow the beans to soak up the water and begin to sprout. Choose a low-traffic location to avoid spilling your beans. Some great storage locations include:   The corner of a pantry Under your kitchen sink In an unused cabinet"
2364,Cook Mung Beans,13,C,C4,Drain the water and cover the beans.,"After twenty four hours, drain the water away from the beans. You can either dump the entire mixture in a colander or carefully tip the bowl over the sink. Next, cover the bowl with a piece of cheesecloth, gauze, or a thin dishtowel. This will protect the beans while allowing air flow. Return the beans to their cool, dark spot to continue sprouting. Cheesecloth can be bought at most gourmet grocery stores, cheese making depots, and online."
2365,Cook Mung Beans,14,C,C5,Examine the beans.,"After twenty four to forty eight hours have passed, examine the beans to see if they’re ready to eat. Sprouted beans will have a small white tail and a split bean body. If you prefer bean sprouts with longer tails, let the beans continue sprouting for a few more hours.Don’t let the beans sprout for more than a few days. Otherwise, the beans will become waterlogged and flavorless."
2366,Cook Mung Beans,15,C,C6,Serve the beans.,"First, rinse the sprouted beans under cold water to remove any unwanted debris or residue. Allow the beans to dry for a few minutes on a plate lined with a paper towel. Serve the beans immediately. Some excellent serving methods include:   Adding the beans to a salad Seasoning the beans with olive oil, salt, and pepper for a fresh side dishLining your sandwich with sprouts for a healthy crunch"
2368,Cook Mung Beans,17,D,D2,Add sprouted mung beans to any savory recipe.,Sprouted mung beans are incredibly versatile. They can be sprinkled on a salad for a crunchy health boost or sautéed in a stir fry. Some other fantastic ways to use freshly sprouted mung beans include:   Adding a layer of bean sprouts to your sandwiches Stirring mung bean sprouts into your favorite vegetable soup Garnishing your favorite Asian noodle dish
2369,Cook Mung Beans,18,D,D3,Make a mung bean curry.,"The hearty mung bean pairs deliciously with traditional curry flavors such as garam masala, coconut milk, ginger, and lime.Do an online search to find your new favorite mung bean curry recipe. Alternatively, stir some cooked mung beans into your favorite curry recipe to incorporate extra flavor and nutrition. Some excellent curries include:   An Indonesian curry such as Gulai Salai Ikan Khas Palembang   Palak Paneer, an Indian curry Slow-cooker Chicken Curry"
2370,Boil Crawfish,0,none,1,Buy live crawfish.,"Plan on ordering enough crawfish so that each person at your party or dinner gets 2 - 3 pounds. Most of the weight will get discarded since crawfish come with their shells on.   Source the crawfish from seafood and grocery stores or crawfish trucks, which sell crawfish when it's in season. If you don't have a source of crawfish in your area, purchase it online from a vendor such as Louisiana Crawfish co., which will ship the crawfish to you live. When you take home your crawfish or receive your shipment make sure you keep them cool, away from light and heat, so they're fresh when it's time to cook them. Boiled crawfish that have been frozen do not taste nearly as good as live boiled crawfish.;"
2371,Boil Crawfish,1,none,2,Wash the crawfish.,"Since live crawfish are freshly harvested, it's necessary to wash of the silt and debris they have collected before you cook them. Clean your crawfish by taking the following steps:   Wash off the sack. If you bought a sack of crawfish, begin with washing it off so the dirt from the outside of the sack doesn't make its way inside. Empty the sack of crawfish into a large bin, such as a kiddie pool or storage bin, and fill it with clean water. Use a paddle to stir the crawfish, then let them sit in the water for 30 minutes. Discard the dead crawfish, which will float to the top after a few minutes. Strain the water and rinse the crawfish with clean water. Keep them in a shady spot until you're ready to boil them."
2372,Boil Crawfish,2,none,3,Light the outdoor cooking flame.,"Use an outdoor gas burner, a patio stove, or a propane cooker to make the boil. The important thing is to have equipment sturdy enough to heat up a 60 gallon (227.1 L) pot of water."
2373,Boil Crawfish,3,none,4,Fill a 60 gallon (227.1 L) pot halfway with water.,"Put it on the burner or stove and let it heat to a boil. Stir in the following ingredients, then let it come back to a boil:   The juice of 8 lemons, and the lemon peels. 1 pound of crawfish boil seasoning."
2374,Boil Crawfish,4,none,5,Add the vegetables.,"Crawfish boils are delicious with many kind of vegetables, but the most popular staples are potatoes and corn. Once the pot has come back to a rolling boil, add the following ingredients:   8 onions, peeled and halved 10 pounds of new potatoes (or regular potatoes, chopped into bite-sized chunks) 20 ears of corn, shucked and halved 40 cloves of garlic, peeled"
2375,Boil Crawfish,5,none,6,Lower the crawfish into the boil.,"Place the crawfish in a crawfish basket, made out of wire with a handle for lowering it into the pot. Crawfish baskets are used so that the crawfish can boil in the top part of the water while the vegetables cook underneath. Let the crawfish boil in the water for 5 minutes.   If you have a large strainer that fits over the top of the pot, this can be used as a substitute for the crawfish basket. Crawfish baskets are available online or at stores that sell barbecue equipment."
2376,Boil Crawfish,6,none,7,Turn off the heat and let the crawfish cook.,"Once the crawfish are inside the pot, turn off the heat and put the lid on top to allow the crawfish to cook gently for another 30 minutes."
2377,Boil Crawfish,7,none,8,Check the crawfish.,"After 30 minutes, remove the lid and check to see if the crawfish are done. The best way to tell is by removing a crawfish and eating it.   If the texture is rubbery, the crawfish need more time to cook.If they're on the verge of falling apart, remove the crawfish from the pot immediately, as they're in danger of overcooking."
2378,Boil Crawfish,8,none,9,Line picnic tables with newspapers.,"Crawfish boils can get messy, so for easy cleanup it's best to use plenty of newspaper. Line picnic tables and other outdoor tables, and set out plenty of napkins and paper towels. You might want to set out bowls for the crawfish shells and legs."
2379,Boil Crawfish,9,none,10,Serve the boil.,"At traditional boils, the vegetables are dumped directly onto the table, and the crawfish are added to the top. If you'd prefer not to do it this way, have guests line up at the pot with paper plates and scoop the vegetables directly from the pot to the plates."
2380,Boil Crawfish,10,none,11,Add condiments.,"Butter, salt, and additional Cajun seasoning are all great condiments for a crawfish boil."
2381,Cook Broccolini,0,A,A1,Bring a large stockpot of water to boil.,Fill the stockpot roughly two-thirds full with water and heat the water on the stove over high heat.
2382,Cook Broccolini,1,A,A2,Add salt.,"Sprinkle roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt into the stockpot for every 4 qt (4 L) of water. Let boil for another minute or two so that the salt can dissolve.  By adding the salt after the water reaches a boil, you cut down on the total amount of time it takes the water to reach a boil. Salt water boils more slowly than regular water."
2383,Cook Broccolini,2,A,A3,Cook the broccolini for a few minutes.,"Add the broccolini and cook for 2.5 to 5 minutes, depending on how tender you want the broccolini to be.Drain immediately by pouring the contents of the stockpot through a colander. If you allow the broccolini to stay in the hot water longer, it will continue to cook and may get mushy. Cook for 2.5 minutes if you want the broccolini to be tender-crisp. If you want it to be a little softer without a crisp bite, cook for a full 5 minutes."
2384,Cook Broccolini,3,A,A4,"Drizzle with oil, lemon juice, and seasonings before serving.","Return the broccolini to the stockpot and add the olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, and garlic powder. Toss with tongs or a spatula and serve while still warm."
2385,Cook Broccolini,4,B,B1,Bring a stockpot of salted water to a boil.,Fill a stockpot roughly two-thirds full with water and add a generous amount of salt. Heat on the stove over high heat.  Use roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt for every 4 qt (4 L) of water.
2386,Cook Broccolini,5,B,B2,Briefly blanch the broccolini.,"Add the broccolini to the boiling water and cook for no longer than 2 minutes.  Drain immediately when done. Pour the broccolini through a colander or remove it from the stockpot with tongs. If you drag your feet on this step and let the vegetable stay in the hot water for too long, it will continue to cook and may become too tender or mushy."
2387,Cook Broccolini,6,B,B3,Dunk in a bowl of ice water.,"Transfer the broccolini to a large bowl filled with ice cold water to stop the cooking process.  Leave the broccolini in the ice water for about 2 minutes. As a general rule, blanched vegetables should be left in ice water for as long as they were left in boiling water in order to put a full stop to the cooking process."
2388,Cook Broccolini,7,B,B4,Pour the oil into a large skillet.,"As the broccolini sits in the ice water, heat the skillet of oil over medium-high heat for a couple of minutes, or until the oil becomes thinner and easier to coat over the pan."
2389,Cook Broccolini,8,B,B5,Add the broccolini.,"Transfer the broccolini from the ice water and directly into the hot oil in the skillet. Cook for 2 minutes, or until warm and beginning to caramelize on the tips.Do not be alarmed if the broccolini sizzles once you place it in the pan. The violent sizzle results when water clinging to the vegetable touches the hot oil. If you want to minimize this reaction, quickly drain the wet broccolini on paper towels before placing it in the skillet."
2390,Cook Broccolini,9,B,B6,Sprinkle with lemon juice and seasonings before serving.,"Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and drizzle with lemon juice. Sprinkle with pepper, garlic powder, and additional salt, if desired, and enjoy."
2393,Cook Broccolini,12,C,C3,"Toss with oil, lemon juice, and seasonings before serving.","Transfer the broccolini to a serving platter and add olive oil. You can also sprinkle with lemon juice, salt, pepper, and garlic powder, if desired. Toss with tongs to coat well and enjoy."
2395,Cook Broccolini,14,D,D2,Arrange the broccolini on the prepared baking sheet.,"Keep the pieces in a single layer.  By arranging the broccolini in one layer, you ensure that the individual pieces cook as evenly as possible."
2396,Cook Broccolini,15,D,D3,Drizzle with oil and toss.,"Drizzle 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) of olive oil over the broccolini and toss lightly with a spatula or tongs to coat evenly.  It is a good idea to toss the broccolini in oil before tossing it in any other seasonings. The oil provides and even coating for the other seasonings to stick to, making it easier for those seasonings to stick for the duration of the cooking process."
2397,Cook Broccolini,16,D,D4,Sprinkle with seasonings and lemon juice.,"If desired, sprinkle the lemon juice, garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste over the broccolini on the baking sheet. Toss well once more to coat again."
2398,Cook Broccolini,17,D,D5,Bake until tender.,"Roast the broccolini in the preheated oven, uncovered, for about 10 to 15 minutes.Stir the broccolini occasionally as it cooks to ensure that all sides and stems get evenly cooked."
2399,Cook Broccolini,18,D,D6,Serve warm.,Transfer the finished broccolini to individual serving plates and enjoy.
2400,Cook Broccolini,19,E,E1,Place the broccolini in a microwave-safe dish.,"Arrange the broccolini in even layers.  If necessary or desired, you can cut the broccolini into smaller pieces. The smaller pieces can be easier to fit inside of a cramped microwaveable dish, so if you are having difficulty fitting the tall, skinny pieces in the dish, cutting them up is a viable option."
2401,Cook Broccolini,20,E,E2,"Add water, lemon juice, and olive oil.","Add 3/4 cup (190 ml) water, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) olive oil, and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) lemon juice to the broccolini. Stir well so that all the broccolini has been coated in the mixture.  Ideally, the broccolini should be mostly submerged under the liquid. If some of the broccolini is submerged but some is not, it may not cook evenly."
2404,Cook Lamb Shanks,0,A,A1,Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C).,;
2405,Cook Lamb Shanks,1,A,A2,Wash and trim the shanks.,"Wash the shanks and use a sharp knife to remove some of the larger deposits of fat, but don't trim the shanks of all visible fat. The fat will render and contribute to the flavor of the final dish."
2406,Cook Lamb Shanks,2,A,A3,Heat the oil.,"Pour the oil into a large dutch oven or another oven-safe dish and place it over medium high heat. Allow it to heat completely, until it begins to smoke just slightly."
2407,Cook Lamb Shanks,3,A,A4,Brown the lamb shanks.,"Season the shanks with salt and pepper on all sides. Place them in the hot oil and brown them on all three sides. Brown each side for about 4 minutes, enough to get a good sear on each side.   Don't cook the lamb shanks all the way through. Browning them will bring out the deep flavor of the shanks, but longer cooking will bring about the soft, fall-apart texture you want. Make sure the oil is nice and hot before you put the shanks in the pot."
2408,Cook Lamb Shanks,4,A,A5,"Add the vegetables, peppercorns and wine.","Arrange the vegetables and garlic cloves around the lamb shanks, and drop in the peppercorns. Pour the wine over the entire contents of the pot. Let the red wine come to a boil, and boil it for three minutes. Add the water and reduce the heat to bring everything to a quick simmer.   Boiling the wine for three minutes will lower the alcohol content a bit, leaving the deep flavor of the wine behind. With the addition of the water, the shanks and vegetables should be fully submerged in liquid. If they aren't, add a little more water."
2409,Cook Lamb Shanks,5,A,A6,Cover the dish and transfer it to the oven for braising.,"If you don't have a tight-fitting lid for the dutch oven, cover it tightly with aluminum foil. Place it in the oven and braise it for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Every half hour, remove it from the oven and turn the shanks so they cook evenly.After 1 hour and 30 minutes, the shanks should be quite tender. If they aren't, return them to the oven and continue braising, checking every 15 minutes until they've reached the correct texture."
2410,Cook Lamb Shanks,6,A,A7,Strain and reduce the braising liquid.,"Transfer the cooked lamb shanks to a serving platter. Pour the braising liquid through a fine-mesh sieve to strain out the vegetables and keep the liquid. Pour the liquid into a saucepan and cook it over medium heat, stirring often, until it has reduced and become a thick sauce.   Season it with salt and pepper to taste. To make the sauce thicker, add a teaspoon of cornstarch."
2411,Cook Lamb Shanks,7,A,A8,Serve the lamb shanks.,Pour the braising liquid over the lamb shanks and serve the dish with roasted vegetables or mashed potatoes. Each shank is enough for one serving.
2415,Cook Lamb Shanks,11,B,B4,Make pockets in the lamb shanks.,Use a sharp knife to slightly separate the meat from the bone at the base of each lamb shank. Put your finger into the holes you've created to make a small pocket in each shank.   Don't completely remove the meat from the bone. Just separate it enough to create a little pocket.
2416,Cook Lamb Shanks,12,B,B5,Stuff the pockets with the butter mixture.,"Divide the mixture between the four shanks, using a spoon to stuff it deep into the pockets. As the shanks bake, the butter will melt and flavor them from the inside out."
2417,Cook Lamb Shanks,13,B,B6,Season the shanks.,Rub the outside of each lamb shank with olive oil and season with salt and pepper.
2418,Cook Lamb Shanks,14,B,B7,Place each lamb shank on a folded piece of aluminum foil.,"Tear off four large pieces of aluminum foil and fold each one in half. Place one lamb shank in the middle of each piece of foil. They should each be in an upright position, with the bones pointing up. Gather the edges of the aluminum foil around the shank and toward the bone, so that each shank is sitting in a sort of bowl shaped from aluminum foil.   Make sure you use enough foil so that it won't rip. You need enough to gather the ends over the bone before putting the packets in the oven."
2419,Cook Lamb Shanks,15,B,B8,Add vegetables and wine to each packet.,"Divide the vegetables evenly among the packets. Divide the garlic cloves evenly among the packets, too. Finally, divide the wine evenly among the packets, pouring a few glugs into each."
2420,Cook Lamb Shanks,16,B,B9,Close the packets.,Twist the aluminum foil around the bones so that each packet is tightly sealed. Arrange them on a baking sheet so they won't drip as they bake.
2421,Cook Lamb Shanks,17,B,B10,Bake the packets.,"Place the baking sheet in the oven and bake the packets for 2 1/2 hours. Check the meat to make sure the lamb shanks are soft and fall-apart tender; if not, return to the oven for a few more minutes."
2422,Cook Lamb Shanks,18,B,B11,Serve the lamb shanks.,"Place each packet on a plate so each person can open his or her own packet of goodness. Serve with vegetables, potatoes and salad."
2423,Cook Lamb Shanks,19,C,C1,"Combine the vegetables, herbs and stock in the slow cooker.","Put the vegetables, garlic, bay leaf, thyme and chicken stock in the slower cooker. Stir the mixture so everything is combined."
2424,Cook Lamb Shanks,20,C,C2,Heat the oil.,Pour the olive oil into a frying pan and place it over medium high heat. Heat the oil until it just begins to smoke. Don't overheat the oil or it will burn.
2425,Cook Lamb Shanks,21,C,C3,Brown the lamb shanks.,"Season them with salt and pepper, then place them in the hot oil. Cook each lamb shank on all three sides, for four minutes on each side. Don't cook the shanks all the way through; just cook them long enough to brown them and bring out their deep flavor."
2426,Cook Lamb Shanks,22,C,C4,Add the lamb shanks to the slow cooker.,"Place them bone-side up in the slow cooker among the vegetables, herbs and stock. Keep the pan in place, since you don't want to waste the drippings."
2427,Cook Lamb Shanks,23,C,C5,Add the wine to the drippings.,Pour the cup of wine into the hot pan and let it come to a simmer. Scrape off the brown bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon or spatula. Add the wine to the slow cooker after 1 minute of simmering.
2428,Cook Lamb Shanks,24,C,C6,Cover the slow cooker and cook the shanks.,"Cook them on high for 6 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions. When the shanks are ready, they should easily fall apart when poked with a fork."
2429,Cook Lamb Shanks,25,C,C7,Serve the shanks.,"Place each one on a plate and ladle some of the vegetable and wine sauce over each one. Serve with potatoes, vegetables or rice."
2430,Cook Black Eyed Peas,0,none,1,Rinse the beans.,Place the black-eyed peas in a colander and rinse them with cool running water.   Rinsing the black-eyed peas removes dirt and stray hulls.;
2431,Cook Black Eyed Peas,1,none,2,Place the beans in a pot of cold water.,"Make sure that the water covers the black-eyed peas completely, but do not fill the pot so high that it will boil over when heated. Cover with the lid of the pot."
2432,Cook Black Eyed Peas,2,none,3,Boil the water.,"Heat the beans and water over medium-high heat until the water reaches a steady boil. Continue boiling for 2 to 3 minutes.   Most beans are soaked in cold water for several hours, but black-eyed peas can be soaked in hot water to reduce the amount of time it takes.It is not essential to soak your black-eyed peas, so this step can be skipped if you are short on time. Soaking the beans causes them to become softer, however, and it also helps to reduce the risk of digestive upset."
2434,Cook Black Eyed Peas,4,none,5,Drain and rinse.,Pour the contents of the pot through a colander to remove the stale water. Rinse the black-eyed peas once more with cool water.
2435,Cook Black Eyed Peas,5,none,6,Select the best type of ham.,"For the most traditional flavor, use salty country ham.   Black-eyed peas can technically be prepared using nothing more than salt and water. The taste of the beans can be rather dull on their own, however, and it is more traditional to prepare them with pork and certain vegetables. Smoked ham steak makes a good choice when cooking black-eyed peas using the alternative slow cooker method. A ham bone works, as well. Use a sweetened ham, like a honey-baked ham, if you want a sweeter taste. Bacon or pancetta are also popular choices to use when preparing black-eyed peas."
2436,Cook Black Eyed Peas,6,none,7,Chop the vegetables.,"The vegetables should be chopped into small pieces with a sharp kitchen knife.   Give the onions a rough chop until the pieces are roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) in size. Use a tangier variety, like a white onion or yellow onion, for a heartier taste. Use a sweet onion variety, like a Vidalia onion, for a milder, sweeter taste. You could also use 1/4 cup (120 ml) dried minced onion flakes instead of the whole onions to save time. Dice the tomatoes into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) chunks, saving the juice. To save time, you can also use a 12-oz (375 ml) can of diced tomatoes. For a spicier twist, select a can a diced tomatoes with chopped green chili peppers.Place the garlic on your cutting board with the broad, dull side of the knife blade held against it. Carefully yet forcefully smack the knife down to break open the garlic and remove the skin. The garlic can be used this way, or you can also mince the garlic into fine pieces with a knife. Alternatively, you can use 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of garlic powder, instead."
2437,Cook Black Eyed Peas,7,none,8,Heat up the ham in oil.,"Heat the oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. Add the ham and cook for 4 minutes or until the edges begin to crisp up, stirring frequently.   This step is only optional. You can prepare the beans without crisping up the pork first."
2438,Cook Black Eyed Peas,8,none,9,Stir the beans into the ham.,Add the pre-soaked black-eyed peas to the same stockpot you used to cook the ham. Stir the beans into the ham to coat with the flavored grease.
2439,Cook Black Eyed Peas,9,none,10,"Add the onion, tomatoes, garlic, and bay leaves.",Stir the ingredients together until thoroughly mixed.
2440,Cook Black Eyed Peas,10,none,11,Fill with 4 cups (1 liter) of water.,"Use cold water.   There should be just enough water to cover the beans and vegetables, and the water level should not extend past three-quarters of the stockpot's height. The 4-cup (1-liter) measurement is merely an estimate. If you did not pre-soak the beans, you will need to use twice as much water."
2441,Cook Black Eyed Peas,11,none,12,Cover and boil.,"Place the cover over the stockpot and heat the contents of the pot over medium-high to high heat, until the water begins to boil. Cook for 10 minutes.   Leave the lid slightly ajar to allow steam to escape slowly. Doing so relieves pressure inside the pot, lessening the odds of the water boiling over and creating a mess."
2442,Cook Black Eyed Peas,12,none,13,"Reduce heat and cook slowly, adding more water as necessary.","Turn the heat down to medium so that the rapid boil slows to a steady simmer. Cook for an additional 1 to 2 hours.   You may not need to add more water. If the water level dips below the black-eyed peas, though, add another 1 cup (250 ml) of warm water. Once the beans are done, they should have a soft, creamy taste, and the juice should be flavorful rather than watery. If the beans lose their shape, however, they have been overcooked. Taste the beans after the first hour. If they are not done, continue checking every half hour after that."
2443,Cook Black Eyed Peas,13,none,14,"Add salt and pepper, if desired.","After the beans have finished cooking, remove the stockpot from the heat and add any salt and pepper you want. Stir the beans to thoroughly incorporate the salt and pepper.   Roughly 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of black pepper should suffice, but you can add more or less depending on how hot you prefer things. If you used salted ham, additional salt may not be necessary. For low-sodium hams, however, you may wish to add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) or so."
2444,Cook Black Eyed Peas,14,none,15,Discard the bay leaves and serve.,Fish out the bay leaves before pouring the beans into individual serving dishes using a ladle.
2445,Cook Black Eyed Peas,15,none,16,Prepare the ingredients as usual.,Soak the black-eyed peas and chop up the vegetables.
2446,Cook Black Eyed Peas,16,none,17,Add the ingredients to the slow cooker.,"Toss the black-eyed peas, tomatoes, onions, garlic, ham, and bay leaves into the slow cooker. Add salt and pepper, if desired. Cover and cook on high for 90 minutesor on low for 3 hours."
2447,Cook Black Eyed Peas,17,none,18,Throw out the bay leaves and serve.,Turn off the slow cooker and dig out the bay leaves. Serve the black-eyed peas while still hot.
2448,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,0,none,1,Wipe away visible dirt.,"If the mushrooms are still caked with dirt or other debris, gently remove it by hand. Use a clean cloth, dry paper towel, or soft-bristled brush if you prefer. Don’t worry too much about getting every bit of dirt.There are kitchen brushes designed to help clean delicate foods, such as shiitake mushrooms. While these can be helpful, they are not necessary. Often, a quick rub with a dry paper towel is sufficient.;"
2449,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,1,none,2,Rinse minimally.,"It’s true that mushrooms will absorb a bit of moisture, so you don’t want to expose them to too much water. However, a quick rinse will not noticeably affect their composition. Simply run the faucet with cold water and hold your shiitakes in the stream for a few moments.Some chefs prefer not to rinse shiitakes. If you know your mushrooms are free of chemicals, consider foregoing the use of any water at all."
2450,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,2,none,3,Shake or spin them dry.,"Shake the mushrooms by hand or spin them in a salad spinner to remove residual water. If water remains caught on the underside of a particular mushroom, hold it by the stem and shake more vigorously.Rinse again if visible dirt remains."
2451,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,3,none,4,Pry off each mushroom’s stem.,"While keeping the stem is a matter of personal preference when preparing many mushrooms, shiitake stems should always be removed. To remove a shiitake stem, tightly pinch it right where it meets the cap. Then slowly pry the stem away from the cap in the opposite direction the stem is leaning.For instance, if you’re holding the mushroom upside down and the stem is leaning towards you, pry the stem away from you. Discard the stems or save them for use in soups and stocks."
2452,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,4,none,5,Remove dried mushroom's stems before re-hydrating.,"Dried shiitake mushrooms aren't quite as flavorful, but they can be good to keep on hand because they last a long time and are especially useful in some dishes. They do require a bit more prep work, however, as they need to be soaked in water prior to cooking. Just be sure to snap off the stems first, as it's much easier to do while they're still dry."
2453,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,5,none,6,Slice from the top of the cap.,"Depending on how you wish to use your shiitake mushrooms, you may wish to cut them up. Thin slices are recommended. Place a cap right side up on a cutting board and carefully cut it into thin slices.If you’re comfortable doing so, you can stack one shiitake mushroom cap on top of another and slice them simultaneously in order to save time."
2456,Clean Shiitake Mushrooms,8,none,9,Store mushrooms in the fridge.,"Refrigeration can help keep your mushrooms fresh. Keep them in an open plastic bag, as they need access to air. If you purchase them fresh, they will last for a few days.If you want to preserve shiitakes in the fridge for a bit longer, cut off their gills. This will keep the rest of the mushroom fresh for about a week."

2480,Make Frito Pie,2,A,A3,Cover with chili.,"You can use any kind of canned chili, or make your own using the recipe below.   Optionally, add diced tomatoes, canned or fresh."
2481,Make Frito Pie,3,A,A4,Bake for 15 minutes.,"Once your oven is preheated, put the casserole dish in the oven. Leave it for about fifteen minutes, until the chili is hot.   For an even easier recipe, add all the ingredients on top of the chili and bake in one sitting."
2482,Make Frito Pie,4,A,A5,Top with other ingredients.,"Spread a layer of sour cream over the chili with a spoon. Top with the diced onion, the rest of the Fritos, and the grated cheese. The Fritos on top will stay much crunchier than the Fritos at the bottom of the pan.   Optionally, sprinkle the sour cream layer with shredded lettuce for a fresher taste."
2483,Make Frito Pie,5,A,A6,Bake for another five minutes.,"Return to the oven and bake a few minutes longer, until the cheese is melted. Serve hot."
2484,Make Frito Pie,6,B,B1,Heat chili on the stove.,"Pour the can of chili into a pan over medium heat. Cover and let warm, stirring occasionally.   You can make homemade chili instead, or use the recipe below. For more flavor, add diced tomatoes and/or canned beans if the canned chili does not include them. Most Texan chili skips both of these ingredients."
2485,Make Frito Pie,7,B,B2,Slit open the side of each Frito bag.,"A ""walking taco"" is a Frito pie served in the Frito bag instead of a bowl. Each person gets one Frito bag. Cut each bag open along the side instead of the top to make a larger opening."
2486,Make Frito Pie,8,B,B3,Spoon chili and cheese into each bag.,"Spoon the chili directly into the Frito bag, then top with melted cheese. You can leave this as is to keep the chips crunchy, or stir it together for a delicious mess.   Diced onions and sour cream are optional toppings. If you want room for more chili, crush some of the chips first by squeezing the bag."
2489,Make Frito Pie,11,C,C3,Brown ground chuck in a large frying pan.,"Add the beef to a hot frying pan and cook until brown. Stir occasionally and break it into even-sized pieces with a wooden spoon. For best results, brown in small batches, so most of the beef can touch the pan surface. This will take a few minutes per batch.   Use a nonstick pan, or nonstick cooking spray."
2490,Make Frito Pie,12,C,C4,Cook the onions until translucent.,"Add the diced onions to the hot pan and cook until translucent, about five minutes."
2491,Make Frito Pie,13,C,C5,Combine chili ingredients in a large saucepan.,"Combine chili pepper puree, beef, and onions in a large pot. The larger and heavier the pot, the better the meat texture will be.Add the chicken or beef stock, beer, cumin, a grind of pepper, and several pinches of salt.   If food has stuck to the frying pan, deglaze it with some of the stock and add it to the chili. Red ale or stout is a good choice.Replace with more stock for a nonalcoholic version; otherwise, about 25% of the alcohol will remain."
2492,Make Frito Pie,14,C,C6,Simmer until the meat is tender.,"Bring to a boil, then simmer uncovered until the meat is tender and the chili is thick, 45–60 minutes. Stir occasionally.   For extra flavor, instead cover with a slightly ajar lid and cook for up to 3 hours."
2493,Make Frito Pie,15,C,C7,Mix in corn flour paste (optional).,"This makes a thicker, less greasy chili. Add the corn flour to a bowl and spoon in some of the chili broth. Stir until it forms a paste, then pour it into the chili. Stir until thoroughly combined."
2494,Make Frito Pie,16,C,C8,Adjust spices and serve.,"Taste the chili. Add more salt, pepper, or cumin if desired. Let it sit off the heat to absorb more flavor and cool enough to eat.

2503,Make Lobster Bisque,0,none,1,Cut each tail in half.,"Carefully cut through the shell of each lobster tail using kitchen shears. Separate the tail in half lengthwise, dividing both the shell and the meat.   If you're using frozen lobster tails, you'll need to thaw the tails completely before beginning. You'll likely need to cut through the top shell first, followed by the bottom shell. Cut through the lobster meat after splitting the shell, following the edge of the divided shell. The lobster meat should remain in the shell after you finish cutting the tails in half. If you notice a large vein in the tail, remove that vein before continuing to the next step.;"
2504,Make Lobster Bisque,1,none,2,Salt and simmer the water.,"Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of water into a stockpot. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to medium once the water begins to simmer.   As soon as the water simmers, add the salt, which should help draw out the flavor of the lobster tails."
2505,Make Lobster Bisque,2,none,3,Steam the tails.,"Place the tails shell-side down inside the steaming basket, then set the basket over the pot of simmering stock. Cover and cook for 5 to 7 minutes.Steam the lobster tails until they're cooked through. The shells should be bright red, and the meat should feel firm and look opaque."
2506,Make Lobster Bisque,3,none,4,Remove the meat.,"Use tongs to remove the lobster tails from the steamer basket and set them onto a separate plate. After cooling them for several minutes, dig the meat out of the shells.   Set aside the lobster meat until later, keeping it in the refrigerator so that it does not spoil. Do not drain the water. This liquid actually absorbs some of the lobster flavor during the steaming process, so you'll actually benefit from adding it to the soup broth later on."
2507,Make Lobster Bisque,4,none,5,Melt half the butter.,"Place 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter into a large stockpot or Dutch oven. Set it on the stove over medium-high heat and allow the butter to melt.   Once the butter melts, carefully turn the pan so that the butter can coat the entire bottom evenly. Note that butter gives the soup a richer flavor, but if desired, you could use olive oil instead. Simply heat the oil until it glistens."
2508,Make Lobster Bisque,5,none,6,"Meanwhile, flatten the shells.","Place the empty shells on the cutting board, insides-down. Using the heel of the hand or the flat side of a large kitchen knife, press down on the shells until they crack and become mostly flat.   By flattening the shells, you guarantee that more of the surface will touch the pan when you saute them in the next step."
2509,Make Lobster Bisque,6,none,7,Saute the shells.,"Place the shells in the melted butter and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes.While you can technically use the shells without cooking them in butter, taking the time to perform this extra step draws more flavor out of them, which will also improve the flavor of the finished soup."
2510,Make Lobster Bisque,7,none,8,Add the aromatics.,"Toss the shallots, celery, and garlic into the stockpot with the lobster. Continue to cook, stirring frequently, for another 2 minutes.   Both the garlic and shallots should become notably more fragrant. The garlic should turn a light golden brown, but the shallots should look slightly translucent."
2511,Make Lobster Bisque,8,none,9,Deglaze the pan.,"Pour the dry white wine into the stockpot. Stir it into the existing ingredients, scraping the bottom of the pan with the spoon as you do.   Deglazing the stockpot lifts off any bits of food that have stuck to the bottom of the pan while cooking. These deglazed bits can make the taste of the dish deeper and more complex."
2512,Make Lobster Bisque,9,none,10,Add the remaining base ingredients.,"Add the tomato paste, undrained diced tomatoes, brandy, stock, and reserved steaming water to the stockpot. Sprinkle in the thyme, paprika, cayenne pepper, and bay leaf. Stir well to combine.   The paprika and cayenne pepper give the lobster bisque a slight kick. If you prefer a milder taste, reduce the amount of omit these two ingredients altogether."
2513,Make Lobster Bisque,10,none,11,Simmer for 30 minutes.,"Bring the soup base to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer the contents of the stockpot for 30 minutes.   Leave the stockpot uncovered during this time. Stir the base occasionally, and adjust the heat as needed to keep the soup at a steady simmer."
2514,Make Lobster Bisque,11,none,12,Melt the remaining butter.,"Add the remaining 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter to a separate skillet. Place the pan on the stove over medium-high heat, and allow the butter to melt and coat the bottom of the pan.   Try to time this step so that the lobster meat is ready once the soup base is ready. Typically, you should melt this butter when the base only has roughly 10 minutes left of simmering time."
2515,Make Lobster Bisque,12,none,13,Saute the meat.,"Cut the reserved lobster meat into large chunks, then toss it into the hot butter. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until the meat becomes lightly browned.   Separate the meat after you finish cooking it. Reserve four large chunks for the garnish, and prepare the rest for use in the soup itself."
2516,Make Lobster Bisque,13,none,14,Strain the soup.,"Pour the simmered soup base through a large, fine mesh sieve. Immediately return the liquid to the stockpot.   Fish through the solid ingredients and remove the bay leaf. Keep the rest of the solids."
2517,Make Lobster Bisque,14,none,15,Puree the solids and some meat.,"Toss the remaining soup solids and the soup portion of the lobster meat into a large blender. Puree the mixture until it becomes smooth.While it may seem unusual if you've never done it before, you should include the shells in this puree. Most of the shells will be blended down, and any chunks that remain will be strained out later."
2518,Make Lobster Bisque,15,none,16,Cook the puree with the liquid base.,"Add the puree back to the soup, mixing well to combine. Simmer the soup for another 10 to 15 minutes."
2519,Make Lobster Bisque,16,none,17,Strain the remaining solids.,"Line the sieve with cheesecloth, then pour the soup through. Return the liquid to the stockpot and discard the remaining solids.   To get as much liquid out as possible, press down on the solids with the back of the mixing spoon, squeezing the liquid out through the cheesecloth and sieve as you do."
2520,Make Lobster Bisque,17,none,18,Add the dairy.,"Stir the heavy cream and half-and-half into the soup. Bring the soup to a gentle simmer over medium-low heat.   Note that it'll be easiest to add the dairy if you previously warm it to room temperature or slightly higher. If you use cold dairy, it may curdle once you add it to the hot soup."
2521,Make Lobster Bisque,18,none,19,Combine the water and starch.,"In a separate small bowl, whisk together 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of cold water and the tapioca flour or cornstarch. Continue mixing until a smooth slurry forms.   The cornstarch slurry acts as a thickener for the soup. Traditional lobster bisque actually uses uncooked rice, and some recipes call for a flour-based roux. Cornstarch slurries are easy to work with, however, and give the finished soup a smooth texture and a shiny appearance."
2522,Make Lobster Bisque,19,none,20,Add the slurry to the soup.,"Add the cornstarch slurry to the soup, stirring to combine. Cook the soup for another 2 or 3 minutes, or until it thickens."
2523,Make Lobster Bisque,20,none,21,Serve with the remaining lobster meat.,"Ladle the finished soup into individual serving bowls. Garnish each bowl with a piece of the reserved lobster meat, and enjoy!   The soup is best served warm and can be enjoyed immediately, but if you want to increase the flavor even more, refrigerate the soup overnight and reheat it on the stove the following day."
2524,Make Choux Pastry,0,none,1,Heat the butter and water together and bring to the boil.,"Add the flour in one amount and stir quickly. Beat for a minute or until it forms a smooth ball and leaves the side of the pan. Allow to cool, however do not seal with cling-film or cover the dough as it may sweat which can affect the end result.;"
2525,Make Choux Pastry,1,none,2,"Place paste in a large bowl, mix-master or food processor.","A food processor makes short work of the dough and makes a good quality pastry, however care must be taken that the dough does not climb under the blade attachment and leak, which it does quite often. The mix-master tends to give the best result, or hand held electric beaters."
2526,Make Choux Pastry,2,none,3,Add the eggs and beat until smooth and thick.,"With a food processor this is about 1 minute worth of 5 second bursts, a mix-master takes about 4 minutes. If making a savoury version, add 1/2 tsp of salt or flavouring powders such as 1/2 tsp ground dried mushrooms, or 30g of finely grated Parmesan cheese. Ensure that your oven has been heated to 220C / 428F. You can do this by checking the thermostat or with an oven thermometer"
2527,Make Choux Pastry,3,none,4,Gather the dough into a piping bag that has been fitted with a 1 & 1/2 cm or 2/3rd of an inch nozzle.,"You may use a plain or a star or fluted nozzle. It is best to fold the top third of the bag down forming a collar and then using a scraper or spatula to load the dough in, no more than 2/3rd the volume of the bag. Folding the collar leaves a clean top of the bag and when the folded collar is lifted up and the bag twisted closed, the filling does not come out the top. Squeeze by twisting the top of the bag further to increase pressure. Shake the bag gently to remove air pockets and then lift the collar up and twist to contain the paste. You can also make your own by using a heavy duty strength snap-lock bag and snipping the corner off one end. Line your tray with baking parchment and you are ready to go. The dough may rest reliably in the bag for up to half an hour. Pipe in your desired shape (see below sections for suggestions) and bake as follows."
2528,Make Choux Pastry,4,none,5,Preheat your oven at least 15 minutes before you bake.,Ideally the temperature should be 235C or 450F for the first 5-10 minutes then the temperature reduced to 190C or 375F for the remaining time.
2529,Make Choux Pastry,5,none,6,Bake for 15-20 minutes until golden and cooked through.,"Or as per advised time if you follow a different recipe.Under no circumstances open the door until this time as the pastry may collapse! When the puffs or shapes are cooked, place on a cooling rack and use as desired. It is recommended to tear open one of the baked goods (preferably one that doesn't look as good as the others) to ensure the pastry is cooked through. For the best crisp result, it is best to cut a small hole in the base of each puff or in a discrete place for steam to escape, then place back into the cooling oven with the door open to dry out giving optimal crispness. When cold, fill as desired. Frequent suggestions are whipped cream, chantilly cream, ice cream or pastry cream. It is best to load your filling into another clean piping bag and filling either from the base, or another discrete place. Eclairs may be neatly slit open at the top or sides, but the side if you wish to cover with a chocolate icing. Choux pastry may also be deep fried for a very indulgent dessert, by spooning or piping the dough into 175C / 347C hot fat, keeping the piping nozzle free above the fat. This process can make churros and a product similar to beignet."
2530,Make Choux Pastry,6,none,7,Pipe the dough into desired shapes as per the following suggestions.,"For profiteroles, hold the bag in an upright position and apply pressure from the top of the bag by twisting the top of the bag to increase pressure. When the paste starts to emerge, place the bag just above the baking paper so the paste touches the paper. Increase pressure by squeezing the bag (ensuring the twisted top does not open) and raise the bag gradually to pipe a ball approx 3cm across (1.25 inches) up to 4cm (1.6 inches) for large puffs. Reduce pressure and using a swift circular movement, cut off the dough. If a small spike remains, it can be patted down with a wet finger. Ensure you leave space for the balls to double in size before you pipe the next one. For beginners, it is very common to have the spike which reduces the more you practice, but is also a sign the dough was not beaten enough so it was a weaker paste. A wet finger gently patting the top will smooth the surface.  For éclairs, Pipe long lines approx 10cm to 4 inches long, but the trick is to ensure you have even pressure to give the best quality result. To cease piping, pull the bag swiftly back in the opposite direction, so if you were piping left to right, with a smooth movement reduce pressure and move the bag to the left.  To make a swan, pipe a wide and short éclair approx 2.5cm / 1 inch wide and 5cm / 2 inches long to make the body. On another tray, pipe an ""S"" shape in the same way as an éclair using a 1cm or 0.4 inch nozzle to make the neck. The piping bag should be even pressure and then cut off, leaving a short narrow end which will make the beak. For a beginner this is tricky so it is easiest to pipe a normal éclair as described and using wet fingers pinch the end to shape. It is best to bake the base of the swan first, then the necks in a separate batch. When cooled, split the body of the swan open and fill with cream, then place the neck in position.  Similar to eclairs, you can then pipe an array of shapes such as rings, letters, or any shape that you prefer. A large donut ring using a wide nozzle is often known as a Paris Brest, which is filled and often topped with chocolate sauce and praline.  To make a large base, or to create a Gateau Saint Honoré, make a paper template to place under your baking parchment. Using a piping bag, Pipe over the shape, either from the middle out in widening spirals, or the outside in, depending on your preferences. The Gâteau Saint-Honoré, is usually such a circle base and then topped with cream and individual puffs. The same method may be used to make squares, pillows and other shapes.  To make a Croquembouche, you will need a large batch of individual puffs. Fill them with whipped cream or pastry cream and create a large pyramidic stack. This is usually built around a cone-hat like frame, or the puffs are stacked and joined in layer with a little caramel as a glue. If you use a frame, it should be covered neatly with the puffs so its invisible. After the stack has been finished drizzle molten caramel over the cone, this is best done by dipping several metal skewers into the caramel and drizzling the caramel with a light waving movement to create fine strands."
2531,Grill a Pizza,0,none,1,Heat the grill.,"Your grill needs to be on high heat. One reason to cook a pizza on a grill is that you can get it hotter than you can your oven. Most professional pizza ovens get much hotter than home ovens, resulting in a crispy crust. You can achieve a crispy crust at home by using a very hot grill.Your grill should be about 550, but 600 degrees is better (with the lid closed). Have your grill heating while you finish up with your ingredients.;"
2532,Grill a Pizza,1,none,2,Prepare the dough.,"When grilling pizza, you can use homemade dough, a premade dough ball, or a premade crust. If you are making your own crust, prepare it through the final stages, including rising. If you're using a store-bought dough ball, make sure it's thawed and risen if it was frozen."
2533,Grill a Pizza,2,none,3,Slice up your ingredients.,"If you're using veggies, make sure they're sliced and ready to go. Also, shred or slice the cheese you're going to use. If you're including meat, make sure it's cooked first and chopped or broken into pizza-sized pieces. Have them all set up in bowls, ready to go."
2534,Grill a Pizza,3,none,4,Have the sauce ready.,"You can use a pre-made pizza sauce or make your own. You can also just tomatoes and olive oil as a sauce, or use another pre-made sauce like barbecue sauce, pesto, or marinara sauce as the base of your pizza.Most stores sell pizza sauce already made in a small jar or can. If you can't find it, marinara sauce is a decent substitute. You can also use Alfredo sauce, too."
2535,Grill a Pizza,4,none,5,Roll out the dough.,"Flour a clean surface, and use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into your desired shape. Both round and square will work, as long as they fit on your grill. However, try not to get them too big, as it can be more difficult to flip.You'll need to turn the pizza as you roll to get it rolled out evenly. You'll also be fighting the elasticity of the dough. You don't want to get the dough too thin, as it can go through the grate. Keep it a little thicker than you would normally roll the dough. Lightly flour a pizza peel or other flat surface (like a pizza pan) to take the pizza out to the grill."
2536,Grill a Pizza,5,none,6,Oil the grate.,"Once your grill is heated up, you need to oil the grate. The oil will help keep the pizza from sticking. You can use a plain olive oil, or you can use one flavored with another herb or seasoning, such as garlic, to add flavor to the pizza as you grill it."
2537,Grill a Pizza,6,none,7,Oil the top side of the pizza.,"Oil is your friend when it comes to grilling pizza because the dough has a tendency to stick. Brush the top of the dough with more olive oil, being generous across the top of it. You can use a flavored or plain olive oil."
2538,Grill a Pizza,7,none,8,Grill one side of the pizza crust.,"Place the crust on the grill. You should place it oil-side down on the grill, so it keep it from sticking to the grill. Brush the side that's sticking up with more olive oil, then let it cook for about 3 minutes with the lid open and then a couple minutes with the grill closed.Check it after a minute or two with the lid closed. The bottom should be starting to set up. You don't necessarily want that side crispy. Lift up the edge of the pizza with tongs to check it. Grill marks are fine."
2539,Grill a Pizza,8,none,9,Flip the pizza.,"Once the pizza starts to set up and grill marks, flip it over. It should be starting to get brown. You can use tongs to flip it, but if you're having trouble, try using a spatula, too, to help you flip it. It shouldn't be sticking at all if it's cooked enough."
2540,Grill a Pizza,9,none,10,Pour on your sauce.,"Now that you have it flipped, it's time to add the sauce. Add on a spoonful or two of sauce. You can also use more olive oil instead, if you prefer. Quickly spread out the sauce over the whole surface of the pizza. You can use the back of a spoon or ladle to spread out the sauce. Go light on the sauce or the pizza could be soggy."
2541,Grill a Pizza,10,none,11,Add your toppings.,"Sprinkle the cheese on, or lay out slices of fresh mozzarella, if that's what you're using. You probably don't need as much as you think you do. Layer your other toppings over the top of the cheese, including your vegetables and your meats."
2542,Grill a Pizza,11,none,12,Close the lid.,"The pizza toppings will cook better with the lid on the grill because it traps the heat and turns it back on the pizza. You'll only need to cook it about another 5 minutes, perhaps a bit less. If it smells like it's burning, you may need to move the pizza over to a cooler part of the grill.Check it after 3 minutes to see if it's done. Sometimes, the pizza will cook faster."
2543,Grill a Pizza,12,none,13,Pull the pizza off.,"When the cheese is melted and the pizza is done, use the tongs or a spatula to pull the pizza off onto a clean, flat surface. A baking pan or cutting board works well. The bottom of the pizza should be fairly stiff now, making it easier to move."
2544,Grill a Pizza,13,none,14,Cut the pizza into slices.,You can use a pizza cutter or a knife to slice up the pizza. Kitchen shears also work well for cutting pizza. Serve up the pizza on plates with a salad or a fruit salad on the side. You can also top it with Parmesan.

2558,Make a Connecticut Lobster Roll,2,none,3,Cook the lobsters.,"Allow the water to return to a boil. Once the water is boiling, set a timer for 20 minutes. Cook the lobsters for this amount of time, or until they turn a bright, vivid red. Use the tongs to remove the lobsters from the pot."
2559,Make a Connecticut Lobster Roll,3,none,4,Allow the lobsters to cool.,"Place the lobsters on a large plate or platter. Allow the lobsters to cool before handling. Alternatively, you can run the lobsters under cold water to speed up the cooling process."
2560,Make a Connecticut Lobster Roll,4,none,5,Remove the meat from the shells.,Twist off the claws and legs from the lobster body. Break the claws into three sections and use a lobster cracker or rolling pin to break into the shells. Use your hands or a fork to pull the meat from the claws and legs.
2561,Make a Connecticut Lobster Roll,5,none,6,Chop the lobster meat.,"After you remove the lobster meat from the claws and legs, use a knife to chop it. You will want the consistency of the lobster to be roughly chopped for the sandwich."

Drop the shrimp pieces into the oil and fry each piece for 2 to 3 minutes.          You can test whether the oil is ready using a kitchen thermometer, or by dipping the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil; if the spoon bubbles, the oil is ready to fry. If you don't want to deep fry the shrimp, you can fry them in a shallow pan. Fry them on one side for 1 1/2 minutes, then flip the shrimp using a pair of tongs and fry them on the other side for 1 1/2 minutes."

2661,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,0,none,1,Consider separating the whites and yolks.You can dehydrate the whole egg or dehydrate the white and yolk separately.,"If you plan on using the whites and yolks separately when you reconstitute the eggs, you'll need to separate the eggs before dehydrating them.;"
2662,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,1,none,2,Beat the eggs.,"Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs, regardless of whether you are using whole eggs or separated whites and yolks.   Alternatively, you could beat the eggs thoroughly by placing them in a food processor or blender and mixing them on medium speed for about a minute.If you separated the whites and the yolks, beat the egg whites until stiff peaks form and the egg yolks until they become thick and foamy."
2663,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,2,none,3,Scramble the eggs.Break open the eggs and lightly beat them with a fork or whisk.,"Pour the mixture into a nonstick skillet and cook for several minutes, stirring often, until the eggs are set but still soft.   Use a nonstick skillet and do not cook the eggs with any added oil or butter. Fats will lower the shelf-life and make the powdered eggs go rancid quicker. Similarly, you should not add any milk, cheese, or other ingredients to the eggs before dehydrating them. Break the eggs up with your spatula as you cook them. Smaller pieces will dehydrate quicker and more evenly."
2664,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,3,none,4,"Alternatively, hard boil the eggs.","Cook the eggs in boiling water for 10 to 12 minutes. Cool the boiled eggs, peel them, and chop the whites and yolks into small pieces. You can either separate the whites and yolks or keep them together.   To hard boil eggs, place the eggs in a saucepan and cover them with about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of cold water. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium to medium-high heat. Once the water reaches a boil, turn off the heat and place a lid on the saucepan. Allow the eggs to finish cooking in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes. You can determine whether or not the egg is hard boiled by spinning it on its side on a hard table or counter. An egg that spins fast is hard boiled. An egg that spins slowly is soft boiled. Cool the eggs in cold water as soon as you remove them from the saucepan. Doing this sooner makes it easier to remove the shell. If you plan on dehydrating the whites and yolks separately, separate them before you chop them into pieces."
2665,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,4,none,5,Prepare the dehydrator trays.,"Place plastic, rimmed dehydrator discs into each dehydrator tray you expect to use.   This is especially important if you are working with raw eggs since the shallow rim will prevent the liquid from running off the side of the tray."
2666,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,5,none,6,Pour the eggs into the dehydrator trays.,"Roughly half a dozen whole eggs should fit on each standard dehydrator tray. Each tray should also be able to hold one dozen egg whites or one dozen egg yolks.   When working with raw eggs, simply pour the beaten egg mixture into each tray. A thin layer is preferable to a thick one. When working with cooked eggs, evenly spread the cooked egg pieces out over the tray, keeping them in a single layer."
2667,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,6,none,7,Run the dehydrator until the eggs are crispy.,"Place the trays in your dehydrator and set the machine to a high heat, between 135 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (57 and 63 degrees Celsius). Dehydrate the eggs until they look like coarse, dry crumbs.   For raw eggs, the process will usually take around 8 to 10 hours. For cooked eggs, the process will usually take around 10 to 12 hours. If you notice any grease lingering on otherwise dried eggs, you should dab it off with a paper towel and let the affected eggs dry a little longer before moving on."
2669,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,8,none,9,Pour the eggs into nonstick trays.,"Pour or spread out the prepared eggs onto nonstick baking sheets with shallow rims. You can usually fit between 6 to 12 whole eggs per baking sheet.   Do not coat the baking sheet with any additional oils since fats will cause the end product to spoil faster. Pour raw eggs into each baking sheet in a thin layer. Evenly spread out small pieces of cooked egg over each baking sheet, keeping the eggs in a single layer."
2670,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,9,none,10,"Bake the eggs until crisp, stirring often.","Place the baking sheets in your preheated oven and cook the eggs until they become brittle and crispy. Depending on the temperature of your oven, this can take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours.   Stir the eggs every two hours or so to promote even drying. If some eggs appear to dry faster than others, you can remove them early to prevent them from burning. Let the rest of the eggs continue dehydrating."
2671,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,10,none,11,Grind the dried eggs in a food processor.,"Place the dried eggs in a clean blender or food processor. Mix on a high setting for a minute or two until a fine, consistent powder forms.   You must grind the eggs down into a fine powder; crumbs are not small enough. If you do not grind the eggs down thoroughly, they will become grainy when you try to reconstitute them. You could also grind the eggs down using a seed grinder or mortar and pestle. Doing so can take more time and energy, but the results will be the same."
2672,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,11,none,12,Keep the eggs in an airtight container.,"Place the powdered eggs in sanitized glass jars equipped with tight lids.   You can usually pack the jar to the very top without leaving any empty headspace. If possible, use a container with non-permeable sides, like a glass jar. It is also ideal to use a container that you can vacuum seal after packing it."
2673,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,12,none,13,"Store the powdered eggs in a cool, dark place.","A pantry or cupboard will usually work, but a food storage area in a cellar might be even better. Storing the eggs in a refrigerator will also work.   If the eggs have been thoroughly dehydrated and stored properly, they are usually safe for several months to about two years. If any moisture or fat remains, or if the eggs are not stored in an airtight container, the shelf-life is drastically reduced. Under these conditions, powdered eggs may only last one week at room temperature or three to four weeks in the refrigerator. For longer storage, place the powdered eggs in a freezer. Frozen powdered eggs can last for five years or more. Make sure that the container you use is freezer-safe, however."
2674,Dehydrate Eggs for Powdered Eggs,13,none,14,Reconstitute the eggs by mixing the powder with water.,"Mix 1 Tbsp to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) warm water with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) powdered eggs. Stir the two ingredients together thoroughly, then let it sit for about 5 minutes, or until the eggs thicken and set.   Once the eggs have been rehydrated, you should be able to use them as you would use regular eggs. Cook the eggs after rehydrating them. Raw powdered eggs should always be cooked, and pre-cooked scrambled powdered eggs will usually need to be cooked again for the sake of texture. Pre-cooked boiled eggs may not need to be cooked again, though."

2713,Make Lo Mein,9,none,10,Add the noodles to the pan.,"After you’ve cooked the snow peas and greens with the mixture, stir in the cooked noodles. Use tongs or chopsticks to move them through the pan, so they’re not all stuck together in a clump.         The noodles can sometimes get stuck together when they sit in the bowl after cooking. To ensure that they’re loose when you add them to the pan, you may want to rinse them with warm water to break up any clumps.

2821,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,1,none,2,Soak some toothpicks in water.,"To secure the pinwheels for grilling, you’ll need toothpicks to keep the rolls shut as they cooks. However, you need to soak the toothpicks in water first to keep them from burning. Place 8 to 10 toothpicks in a glass of water for at least 20 minutes.You can also use wooden skewers usually used for making kabobs. Soak them as you would the toothpicks."
2822,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,2,none,3,Butterfly the steak.,"For the pinwheels, you’ll need 1 large flank steak that’s approximately 1 to 2 pounds (454 to 904 g). Ready it for the pinwheels by taking a very sharp knife and cutting the steak in half horizontally with the grain of the meat. Stop approximately 1-inch (2.5-cm) from where you would completely slice it in half, though, so the steak remains intact.Before you butterfly the steak, you may want to slice off the edges to create a square. That often makes it easier to roll it up later. As you’re cutting the steak, trim away any fat that you see. If you’re not comfortable butterflying the steak yourself, you can ask your butcher to do it when you buy the steak."
2823,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,3,none,4,Open up the steak and season it with salt and pepper.,"Once the steak is butterflied, unfold it so it lays flat on your work surface. Season both sides of the meat with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.You can add other herbs to season the steak if you like. Italian seasoning, oregano, or basil would all work well."
2824,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,4,none,5,Layer the Asiago on the steak.,"When the steak is properly seasoned, lay it out so the grain runs left to right. Spread 6 ounces (150 g) of shredded Asiago cheese across the meat to make the first layer of the pinwheel.You can substitute mozzarella or provolone for the Asiago if you prefer. Make sure to leave a 1-inch (2.5-cm) border on one end of the meat. That way, when you roll up the steak, the fillings won’t spill out."
2825,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,5,none,6,Place the spinach over the Asiago.,"With the Asiago cheese in place on the steak, lay 8 ounces (225 g) of loose spinach leaves with the stems removed over it. Try to create as even as layer of the leaves as possible.You can substitute arugula leaves for the spinach if you prefer."
2826,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,6,none,7,Lay the Gorgonzola and scallions over the spinach.,"After you’ve added the spinach layer, place 6 ounces (188 g) of crumbled Gorgonzola over it. Next, set 4 whole scallions over the Gorgonzola to serve as the final layer of the pinwheel.You can omit the scallions if you prefer."
2827,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,7,none,8,Roll the steak up tightly.,"When all of the layers are in place on the steak, start rolling it up on one of the long sides. Roll away from you, keeping the steak as tight as possible.Make sure to tuck the fillings in as you roll to keep them from falling out."
2828,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,8,none,9,Use toothpicks to seal the seam of the steak.,"Once the steak is fully rolled up, close the seam with the soaked toothpicks. Place them as evenly as you can along the seam so the meat is divided equally."
2829,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,9,none,10,Cut the pinwheel into slices.,"With a sharp knife, carefully cut the pinwheel into slices. Use the toothpicks as a guide, cutting just behind each one. That will keep all of the pinwheels closed.Handle the steak very gently as you cut it to avoid squeezing out too much of the filling. You should wind up with 8 to 10 pinwheels when you’re finished cutting the steak."
2830,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,10,none,11,Place the pinwheel slices in the pan and grill for several minutes.,"When the slices are cut, set them in the heated grill pan. Allow the pinwheels to cook for 6 to 7 minutes for medium-rare to medium.Adjust the cooking time based on your doneness preference. Cook the first side for 8 to 10 minutes for medium-well to well."
2831,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,11,none,12,Flip the pinwheels and cook on the other side for several minutes.,"Once the first side of the pinwheels is finished cooking, use a spatula to carefully flip them over. Allow them to cook on the other side for another 6 to 7 minutes.You should cook each side of the pinwheel for the same amount of time, so if you’re adjusting the cooking time for the first side, do the same for the second side. To ensure that your steak is cooked properly, it’s a good idea to use a digital meat thermometer to test the temperature. Look for 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius) for medium-rare or 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) for medium. For medium-well, look for 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius). Well done steaks should be at 155 to 160 degrees Fahrenheit (68 to 71 degrees Celsius)."
2832,Make Flank Steak Pinwheels,12,none,13,Remove the toothpicks and allow the pinwheels to rest.,"When the pinwheels are finished cooking, transfer them to a cutting board. Take out the toothpicks, and let the meat rest for approximately 5 minutes. Next, plate the pinwheels up and serve."
2833,Make Ceviche,0,A,A1,Debone 2 lbs. of fresh red snapper fillets.," To remove the bones from the fillets, simply run a knife along the snapper and cut off the hard white bones."
2834,Make Ceviche,1,A,A2,Cut the fillets into 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) strips.,
2835,Make Ceviche,2,A,A3,Place the fillets and marinade ingredients in a non-reactive casserole dish.,"Place the fillets, 1/2 finely diced onion, 1 cup of chopped tomatoes, 1 finely diced and seeded serrano chili, 2 tsp. of salt, one pinch of cayenne pepper, and one dash of ground oregano in either a Pyrex or ceramic fish."

2837,Make Ceviche,4,A,A5,Cover the dish.,
2838,Make Ceviche,5,A,A6,Refrigerate the dish for one hour.,
2839,Make Ceviche,6,A,A7,Remove the fish from the refrigerator and stir.,"After the fish has soaked in the juices, you should stir the fish and ingredients carefully, so they're evenly distributed over the fish."
2840,Make Ceviche,7,A,A8,Return the dish to the refrigerator.,"Let it sit for a few more hours. This will give the flavors enough time to blend and to fill the fish with a tangy, refreshing flavor. As the fish absorbs the flavor, its color will change from a pinkish gray and translucent to a whiter color."
2842,Make Ceviche,9,A,A10,Serve.,Remove the dish from the refrigerator and serve with tortilla chips. The ceviche can be enjoyed as a dip for the tortilla chips or the chips can serve as a compliment to the dish.
2843,Make Ceviche,10,B,B1,Rinse 1 lb. of bay scallops., Place them in a medium-sized bowl once they're rinsed.
2844,Make Ceviche,11,B,B2,Pour lime juice over the scallops.,You should juice 8 medium-sized limes to create freshly-squeezed lime juice. The scallops should be completely soaked in the juice. You can even stir them just a bit to make sure that the juice is evenly distributed.

2849,Make Ceviche,16,C,C1,Dice 2 lbs. of tilapia fillets.," Dice it finely. It's easier to dice tilapia when it's partially frozen, and this is also better for its presentation."
2850,Make Ceviche,17,C,C2,Place the tilapia in a medium bowl.,
2851,Make Ceviche,18,C,C3,Pour 1 cup of lime juice over the tilapia.,You should squeeze about 8 limes to get 1 cup of lime juice. Mix the tilapia and juice gently to combine the flavors.
2853,Make Ceviche,20,C,C5,Remove the fish from the refrigerator and drain the lime juice.,Pour the juice out of the bowl and gently squeeze the fish with your hands (if you're wearing gloves) or press into it gently with a wooden spoon. You can discard the lime juice.

2855,Make Ceviche,22,C,C7,Season the mixture with salt and pepper to taste.,
2856,Make Ceviche,23,C,C8,"Add 1/2 cup of clam-tomato juice, 1 tbsp. of hot sauce, and 1 diced serrano chile to the mixture.", Clamato is a popular brand of clam-tomato juice.
2859,Make Ceviche,26,C,C11,Serve.,Arrange the slices of 1 sliced avocado on top of the ceviche and serve this delicious dish with a wedge of lime.
2860,Make Ceviche,27,D,D1,Clean and cook 1/2 lb. of crawfish tail meat.," Most crawfish tail meat is sold peeled, cooked, and ready to eat, but if it's not cooked, then you'll need to heat it over a skillet for 1-10 minutes, until the meat becomes tougher but not mealy."
2861,Make Ceviche,28,D,D2,Peel and devein 1/2 lb. of shrimp.," To peel the shrimp, just pull off the head along with the legs. Pull up from the head and remove the outer shell. To devein the shrimp, just use a small paring knife to cut along the outer edge of the shrimp's back. Cut 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) into the back, until you reach the dark greenish vein. Pull the vein out with your fingers or the tip of the knife. If you can't see the vein, then move on."
2862,Make Ceviche,29,D,D3,Place the seafood into a glass or ceramic bowl.,"Place 1/2 lb. cleaned and cooked crawfish tail meat, 1/2 lb. jumbo lump crabmeat, and 1/2 lb. cooked, peeled, and deveined small shrimp into the bowl. If there are any shells in the meat, pick them off."
2863,Make Ceviche,30,D,D4,Pour 1/2 cup of lime juice over the seafood.,"You can mix the seafood gently to absorb the flavors, but don't break up the crab meat."
2864,Make Ceviche,31,D,D5,Cover and refrigerate.,Let the seafood absorb the flavor of the lime for at least 1 hour.

2868,Make Ceviche,35,D,D9,Serve.,Slice a whole avocado and place it over this delicious mixed seafood ceviche.
2869,Cook Turnip Greens,0,none,1,Wash the greens.,"Rinse the turnip greens under cold, running water, scrubbing them gently with your fingers.   Drain the leaves by drying them in a salad spinner, patting them dry with clean paper towels, or spreading them out on clean paper towels and allowing them to air dry. You could also clean the greens by allowing them to soak in a clean bowl or sink of cold water for several minutes to loosen the dirt. Quickly rinse with running water before draining.;"
2870,Cook Turnip Greens,1,none,2,Remove the stems.,"Cut the stems off at the base of each leaf using a sharp knife.   Examine the leaves as you work. If there are any bruised or wilted leaves, toss them out."
2871,Cook Turnip Greens,2,none,3,Tear apart the leaves.,"Use your fingers to tear the leaves into small pieces.   Each piece should be about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm). You should have roughly 12 cups (3 liters) of torn turnip greens. If desired, you can also give the turnip greens a rough chop with a sharp knife instead of tearing them apart by hand."
2872,Cook Turnip Greens,3,none,4,"Sprinkle with lemon juice.Lightly sprinkle the turnip greens with the lemon juice, tossing them gently with your hands to coat.","Let the turnip greens sit for at least 5 minutes. The lemon juice helps to activate the myrosinase enzymes in the greens and increase the formation of isothiocyanates. In short, the lemon juice prevents the greens from wilting while increasing their nutritional benefits."
2873,Cook Turnip Greens,4,none,5,Boil water in a Dutch oven.,"Fill the Dutch oven halfway with water and add a pinch of salt. Bring the water to a boil over medium-high to high heat.   A 5-quart to 6-quart (5-liter to 6-liter) Dutch oven is recommended. Anything less might be too small, but anything much larger may lead to an unnecessarily long cooking time. If you do not have a Dutch oven, you can use a heavy metal stock pot, instead."
2874,Cook Turnip Greens,5,none,6,Add the greens and cook.,"Add the greens to the boiling water and cover the Dutch oven. Cook the turnip greens for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the greens are tender.Many cooks prefer to extend the cooking time by reducing the heat to medium or medium-low. Once the water slows to a simmer, cook the turnip greens for 45 to 60 minutes."
2875,Cook Turnip Greens,6,none,7,Drain the turnip greens.,Pour the contents of the Dutch oven through a colander to drain the water.   Lightly press the remaining turnip leaves with your hands or the back of a wooden spoon while still inside the colander. Doing so squeezes excess liquid out of the leaves.
2876,Cook Turnip Greens,7,none,8,"Flavor the greens with butter, salt, and pepper.","Transfer the turnip greens to a large bowl and add the butter, salt, and pepper. Toss the greens with the new ingredients to flavor them.   If desired, you can use olive oil instead of butter for a healthier alternative. The salt and pepper should be added according to your personal tastes. If you are uncertain about how much to use, start with roughly 1 tsp (5 ml) salt and 1 tsp (5 ml) black pepper. Toss, taste, and add more as desired."
2877,Cook Turnip Greens,8,none,9,Serve immediately.,Transfer the turnip greens to individual plates and serve.
2878,Cook Turnip Greens,9,none,10,Boil the turnip greens in chicken broth instead of water.,"The greens will absorb the broth, and the broth will add more flavor to the greens."
2879,Cook Turnip Greens,10,none,11,"Add bacon or ham to the cooking liquid.The traditional ""Southern style"" turnip green is prepared with bacon or ham as a way to offset the bitterness of the greens.","Use roughly 1 cup (250 ml) of salt pork, ham, or bacon to the cooking liquid. Brown the meat and add it, along with any pan drippings, to the greens as they begin to cook. You can also add 1 medium chopped onion and up to 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) granulated sugar."
2880,Cook Turnip Greens,11,none,12,Cook the turnip greens in a skillet.,"Instead of cooking the greens in boiling water, sauté them in 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of olive oil until tender.This could take 5 to 15 minutes, depending on how wilted you prefer the greens to be. Instead of using olive oil, you could use bacon grease to add more flavor. Turnip greens will be crisper if prepared this way and will retain more of their bright green color."
2881,Cook Turnip Greens,12,none,13,Drizzle cooked greens with a flavorful dressing.,"Flavored vinegars and vinaigrette dressings are especially common choices.   Balsamic vinegar and cider vinegar both have sweet undertones but add a complimentary tart taste to the greens. Vinaigrette dressings, like raspberry vinaigrette or balsamic vinaigrette, are a little less tart and a little more sweet, but compliment the taste of the greens in a similar manner. Drizzle soy sauce or Teriyaki over the greens for an Asian-inspired flavor. Top with slivered almonds or crunchy chow mein noodles."
2882,Cook Turnip Greens,13,none,14,Add other seasonings to vary the taste of the greens.,"This works especially well if you sauté the greens.   sauté 1 medium onion, chopped, or 1 clove of garlic, minced, before sauteing the turnip greens. Sprinkle red pepper over cooked greens for a spicy kick."
2883,Cook Turnip Greens,14,none,15,"Cook the turnip greens with other greens for a more varied flavor.Try a combination of turnip greens, collard greens, and mustard greens.","Boil equal parts of each with salt, oil, garlic, bacon, and sugar."
2884,Make Coconut Rice,0,A,A1,Place the rice in a colander or sieve.,"Place 2 cups of basmati rice in a colander or sieve and rinse the rice under running, cold water until the water is clear. Just make sure the rice doesn't actually fall through the sieve. You can place the sieve over a bowl to catch any of the rice that may fall out.;"
2885,Make Coconut Rice,1,A,A2,Drain the rice.,"When you're done, add it to a saucepan with the cup of coconut milk, 3 cups of water, and the tablespoon of sea salt."
2886,Make Coconut Rice,2,A,A3,Bring the mixture to a boil.,Stir it occasionally to keep the rice from clumping together.
2887,Make Coconut Rice,3,A,A4,Reduce the heat and leave the rice to simmer for about 10-12 minutes.,"If the water is absorbed really quickly and the rice is still hard, then you can add a little bit more water to the mixture and keep stirring it to make it more fluffy."
2888,Make Coconut Rice,4,A,A5,Serve.,"Serve the rice on its own, or pair it with beef, chicken, or a vegetable mixture."
2889,Make Coconut Rice,5,B,B1,Place the rice in a rice cooker.,Place 2 cups of Thai jasmine-scented white rice in the cooker.

2905,Make Fish Stock,0,none,1,"Choose lean, white fish.","The best types of fish bones to make stock with are those from lean, white, mild-flavored fish such as halibut, cod, flounder, sole, turbot, sea bass, haddock, hake or pollock. You can use a combination of these in your stock, if you wish.;"
2908,Make Fish Stock,3,none,4,Prepare the fish bones.,Rinse the fish bones thoroughly under running water to remove any traces of blood. Use a sharp knife to rough chop the bones into 2 inch (5.1 cm) pieces.
2909,Make Fish Stock,4,none,5,Combine the fish bones and white wine in a large pot.,"Add enough water to cover the bones, approximately 2 US quarts (2,000 ml).   Bring the contents of the boil, periodically skimming the white foam from the surface using a ladle. Once the pot is boiling, reduce the heat to a low simmer."
2910,Make Fish Stock,5,none,6,Add the vegetables and herbs.,"Once you have reduced the heat, add the celery, onions, carrots and herbs to the stock pot.   Add a little more water -- just enough to ensure that the vegetables are completely covered. Leave to simmer, uncovered, for about 20 minutes."
2911,Make Fish Stock,6,none,7,Remove the stock from the heat.,"After 20 minutes of simmering, remove the pot from the heat and give it a good stir.   Leave the stock to steep for 10 minutes, before pouring it through a fine-mesh strainer. Season the stock with sea salt, to taste."
2912,Make Fish Stock,7,none,8,Store the finished stock.,"If you are not planning to use the fish stock in another recipe within the next hour, quickly chill it in the refrigerator.   You should only cover the stock (with a lid or plastic wrap) after it has completely cooled. Fish stock will keep in the refrigerator for up to three days and in the freezer for about two months."
2917,Make Fish Stock,12,none,13,Finished.,
2918,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,0,none,1,Prepare a rub or marinade.,"For the best flavor, you want to season the pork tenderloin prior to smoking it. Depending on your preference, you can use a dry rub or a marinade to help make the pork more flavorful. Prepared rubs or marinades are a good option if you’re in a hurry, but you can also create your own with your favorite spices and ingredients to pair with pork tenderloin.For a tasty dry rub for your pork tenderloin, mix together 1 ¼ cup brown sugar, ⅔ cup sugar, 3 tablespoons black pepper, 2 tablespoons kosher salt, 2 tablespoons ground ginger, 4 ½ teaspoons garlic powder, 4 ½ teaspoons onion salt, 1 tablespoon dry mustard, 1 ½ teaspoons cayenne pepper, 1 ½ teaspoons crushed red pepper, 1 ½ teaspoons ground cumin, 1 ½ teaspoons paprika, and ¾ teaspoon dried thyme.To make a good basic marinade for a pork tenderloin, combine a ½ teaspoon of minced garlic, ¼ cup of cola, ¼ cup of dark brown sugar, ¼ cup of soy sauce, ½ teaspoon of salt, 1 teaspoon of ground pepper, 1 teaspoon minced onion, and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.;"
2919,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,1,none,2,Cut the pork.,"Before applying the rub or marinade to the tenderloin, you may want to cut it to ensure that the pieces will fit on the grill. If you’re dealing with a tenderloin that’s between 1 ½ and 3 pounds, cutting it in half is usually sufficient. For larger pieces of pork, you may need to cut into additional pieces.Pork tenderloins usually have a silvery-looking membrane known as the silverskin on the top of it. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut off the silverskin before applying the rub or marinade. You can also trim away any fat as desired."
2920,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,2,none,3,Season the tenderloin.,"Once the pork is properly cut, it’s time to season the meat. You can apply a dry rub with your fingers, making sure to apply a generous amount and cover all sides of the tenderloin. For a marinade, you can use a pastry brush to cover the entire tenderloin with the mixture.Lightly scoring the tenderloin before you apply a dry rub can help the spices better penetrate the pork. When using a marinade, you can also place it in a plastic zipper bag, add the pork to it, and move the meat around inside to ensure that it is completely covered with the mixture."
2921,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,3,none,4,Let the rub or marinade sit.,"To ensure that the flavors really have time to penetrate the pork, allow the tenderloin to sit with the rub or marinade on it for some time before smoking it. You can wrap the pork in plastic wrap or place it inside a plastic bag and store it in the refrigerator until you’re ready to cook it. With a rub, you can allow it to sit on the meat for 15 minutes to several hours. You may want to let a pork tenderloin in a marinade sit in the refrigerator overnight, but a few hours is usually sufficient.Make sure to keep the seasoned tenderloin refrigerated until it’s time to smoke it. If you marinade has citrus in it, don’t let it sit on the pork for more than two to three hours.Make sure to throw away any excess marinade that’s still in the bag or dish after you remove the pork. It can contaminate other food if you reuse it."
2922,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,4,none,5,Choose the right wood.,"For the best smoking results, the wood that you use makes a big difference. Hickory, apple, cherry, and oak are all effective in helping give your pork a delicious smoky taste. You’re also better off using wood chunks instead of chips because chunks are less likely to cause fire flare-ups.If you are using wood chips, soak them in water for at least an hour before putting them on the grill. Never use sap woods, such as pine for smoking. Not only will they ruin the taste of the pork, they can be toxic."
2923,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,5,none,6,Set up the grill up for indirect grilling.,"To effectively smoke your pork tenderloin, you must use your grill for indirect cooking. For smoking, a charcoal grill works best. Start by removing the grate and opening the grill’s bottom damper. Place coals lit by chimney starter on top of it, making sure that they’re all piled on one side of the grill.If you’re using a gas grill, start the smoking process by preheating it to medium."
2924,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,6,none,7,Add the wood when the grill reaches 250 degrees.,"It’s important to add the wood chunks or chips to the grill when it’s reached a temperature of 250 degrees Fahrenheit (121 degrees Celsius). You can get the grill to the right temperature by gradually adding coals to continue to build up the heat. Once the grill is at the right temperature, place the wood directly on top of the coals.If your grill doesn’t have a temperature gauge, you can test the temperature by holding your hand over the charcoal. If you can do it for three seconds or more, the grill needs additional coals. If it’s too hot to keep your hand over the charcoal for more than two seconds, it’s hot enough If you’re using a gas grill, put the wood in a smoker pouch or box inside the grill, set it to high until you see smoke, and then reduce the grill heat to medium."
2925,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,7,none,8,Place the tenderloin on the grate.,"Once you’ve added the wood to the grill, you’re ready to smoke your pork. Replace the grill’s grate and set the tenderloin on opposite side from the coals. Make sure to close the lid, and open the damper directly above the meat.If you’re using a gas grill, place the tenderloin on the grate directly above the smoker pouch or box."
2926,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,8,none,9,Let the pork smoke for a few hours.,"Smoking is a slow cooking process, so you have to be patient with your tenderloin and avoid opening the grill. It usually takes two and a half to three hours to smoke tenderloins that are approximately 1 ½ to 2 pounds. Make sure that the internal temperature of the pork is at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees Celsius) before you remove it from the grill.As a rule of thumb, it takes approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes per pound to smoke a pork tenderloin. Because you’re cooking with indirect heat, there’s no need to touch or move the meat during the heating process.With a charcoal grill, you will need to open the lid to add fresh lit coals during the smoking process to ensure that the temperature stays at 250 degrees. Use oven mitts to remove the tenderloin and the grate, add more hot charcoal, and then replace the grate and pork so you can close the lid as quickly as possible. A digital meat thermometer makes it easy to figure out if the pork is fully cooked."
2927,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,9,none,10,Allow the pork to cool before slicing.,"Once the pork tenderloin is finished smoking and you’ve removed it from the grill, wrap it in foil and allow it rest for approximately five to ten minutes. That will keep the meat juicy and flavorful. After it’s slightly cooled, slice it for serving.If you want to give your tenderloin extra flavor, you can apply barbecue sauce or more of the marinade that you used right after it comes off the grill and it’s still hot. If you’re using a marinade, just be sure that it’s fresh and hasn’t touched the raw pork."
2928,Smoke Pork Tenderloin,10,none,11,Finished.,
2929,Kettle Cook Potato Chips,0,none,1,Clean and peel as many potatoes as you need based on the amount of chips you want to make.,"If you want healthier chips leave the skin on and clean well.   An average-sized potato yields about 10 to 15 chips, although amounts vary based on the size of the potato and how thinly you slice it. Idaho potatoes are recommended for chips, but you can use any variety you have on hand.;"

2946,Make Lox,0,A,A1,Rinse the salmon and check for bones.,"To prepare homemade lox, you’ll need 1 ½ to 2 pounds (680 to 907 g) of boneless salmon fillet with the skin on. Run some cold water in the sink and rinse the fillet well. Next, examine the fillet to make sure that all of the bones have been removed.You can purchase either ""belly lox"" or regular ""lox"" fillets. Both are salmon, but belly lox comes from the stomach region of the fish. The graining of fat in the stomach region makes belly lox the better option to use when you make lox because it is more widely spaced. This results in a final product that is more desirable and less salty. If there are any pin bones left in the salmon fillet, use a small pair of tweezers or pliers to pull them out in the same direction that they’re facing. Pin bones are more likely to occur in wild salmon than farmed salmon.;"
2947,Make Lox,1,A,A2,Cut the salmon in half.,"Once the salmon is thoroughly rinsed, use a sharp knife to cut the fillet in half. Make sure that the pieces are as equal in size as you can get them."
2948,Make Lox,2,A,A3,Combine the salt and sugar.,"Add 1 cup (288 g) of kosher salt and 1 cup (200 g) of sugar to a medium bowl. Mix the ingredients together well so they’re fully blended.If you like, you can also add about ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of coarsely ground black pepper to the mixture."
2949,Make Lox,3,A,A4,Divide the salt mixture between the two salmon pieces.,"Place the two pieces of salmon in a shallow dish so they’re side by side. Pour an equal amount of the salt mixture over each piece, piling it right on top of the salmon.It may seem that there is a lot of excess salt mixture on the salmon, but the fish will absorb it during the curing process."
2950,Make Lox,4,A,A5,Set the dill on top of salmon and sandwich them together.,"After you’ve added the salt mixture to the salmon pieces, divide half a bunch of dill with the stems removed between them and add it on top of the salt. Next, place one of the salmon pieces on top of the other, being careful not to knock off the salt mixture."
2951,Make Lox,5,A,A6,Wrap the salmon and place it in a plastic bag.,"When the salmon pieces are sandwiched together, carefully wrap them in plastic wrap. Once the fish is secure in the plastic wrap, set it in a large plastic zipper bag.Before closing the zipper bag, be sure to push all of the air out of it first."
2952,Make Lox,6,A,A7,Weigh the salmon down and refrigerate it for a few days.,"Set the bag with the salmon down in a shallow dish. Place another heavy dish on top of the bag to weigh it down, and refrigerate the fish for 2 to 3 days.You can use any heavy item, such as a bottle of wine, to weigh down the salmon."
2953,Make Lox,7,A,A8,Drain the liquid from the container daily.,"While you’re curing the salmon, it’s important to keep it from getting soggy. Remove any liquid that’s been extracted from the salmon from the plastic bag and flip the fish over so both sides are evenly weighed down."
2954,Make Lox,8,A,A9,Taste the fish and remove when it’s reached the desired taste.,"At the two day mark, begin tasting the lox.

2955,Make Lox,9,A,A10,Rinse the fish and slice it.,"After you’ve removed the fish from the plastic wrap, rinse it well under cold water to remove any residue. Use a sharp knife to cut it thin on the bias. Make sure to leave the skin behind.You can freeze the lox if you don’t plan to eat all of it right away. Wrap it well in plastic wrap and place it in a freezer bag for storage. You should eat it within 3 to 4 months."
2958,Make Lox,12,B,B3,Use a back and forth motion with the knife to slice the salmon.,"Once you’ve insert the knife into the salmon, move the blade back and forth in a smooth motion until you’ve cut a slice. You shouldn’t have to push too hard to cut the fish, so if you feel resistance, you may want to sharpen your blade.Use the length of the knife’s blade to make a long, sweeping back and forth motion for the cleanest cuts."
2960,Make Lox,14,C,C1,"Combine the cream cheese, scallions, dill, parsley, milk, and salt.","Add 8 ounces (225 g) of cream cheese that’s been softened to room temperature, 1 tablespoon (10 g) of minced scallions, 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh dill, 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh parsley, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of milk, and a pinch of kosher salt to the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment.

Place them in a medium sized pot and pour in enough water so that it covers the giblets completely by about 2 inches (5.08 cm). Then turn the heat up to medium and let them cook.Many butchers remove the neck and other giblet parts and put them in a sealed bag which they place in the body cavity of the bird.While you are making the giblet gravy, you should also Cook a Turkey. You will use the drippings collected from the turkey to add to the gravy, so be sure to roast the turkey in a pan that collects the drippings in the bottom. Try to time the cooking of your turkey so that it is done roasting either right before you make the gravy or after you finish cooking the giblets.;"
2976,Make Giblet Gravy,1,none,2,Bring the giblets to a boil.,"Cook the giblets over medium heat until they reach a boil. Once the water is boiling, turn the heat down to low and let the giblets simmer for one hour.Simmering the giblets cooks the meat and also infuses the water with flavor to make a broth."

2983,Make Giblet Gravy,8,none,9,Skim the fat off the liquid.,"After the mixture has finished separating, use a ladle or large spoon to scoop the clear fat on top out of the mixture. Make sure not to use too much force and mix up the liquid as you are scooping out the fat.You can also slowly lower the ladle into the liquid and let the fat spill over into the bowl of the ladle. This will ensure that the mixture doesn’t get mixed. Reserve some of the fat so that you can add it to the gravy."
2984,Make Giblet Gravy,9,none,10,Place the roasting pan over medium low heat.,"Take the roasting pan you used to make the turkey and straddle it over two burners. Turn the heat up to medium low on both burners and allow the pan to heat.Using the roasting pan as opposed to a clean pan gives the gravy more flavor, because the dried drippings coating the bottom of the pan will get liquefied by the heat and will add to the flavor of the gravy."

3148,Make a Dump Cake,35,E,E9,Prepare the whipped cream frosting.,"In a mixing bowl, stir together the heavy cream, vanilla extract, and sugar; do not whisk the cream yet. Chill the cream in the fridge for 30 minutes, then beat it with an electric mixer on medium speed until you get stiff peaks.  You can also use your own frosting instead. Buttercream frosting will taste delightful, but store-bought frosting will also do."
3150,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,0,A,A1,Pick your tomatoes wisely.,"Look for tomatoes that are medium in size and firm--softer, older tomatoes tend to get a little mushy when fried. If you are picking your own green tomatoes, try to pick the ones that are just barely getting a hint of a pinkish hue. These are the best for frying because they are less bitter than fully green tomatoes and have a bit of that delicious red tomato flavor."
3151,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,1,A,A2,Heat a medium sized skillet.,"Cast-iron skillets work really well for this recipe, but any heavy skillet will work as well. Add ¼ to ½ inches of cooking oil to the pan. You don’t want to drown the tomatoes in oil so don’t put much more than ½ inches of oil into your pan.   For an extra boost of flavor, add three tablespoons of bacon grease to the oil and stir until it is relatively diluted. The bacon grease will give your tomatoes an extra dose of salty deliciousness."
3152,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,2,A,A3,Wash the green tomatoes in cool water.,Make sure to get rid of any dirt or foreign debris on the surface of the tomato. Pat them dry with paper towels and proceed to the cutting board. Patting them dry will make cutting them a bit easier.
3153,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,3,A,A4,Slice the green tomatoes.,"For tomato slices that stay together best when fried, make 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thick slices. For even sturdier appetizers, cut the tomatoes into thirds.   If you are concerned that your tomatoes might be a little bitter (very green tomatoes can be) add a pinch of sugar each side of the slices. The sugar will cut the bitterness."
3154,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,4,A,A5,Make the mixture you will use to dip your tomatoes in.,"There are many different recipes you can use. The most common one is to combine ½ cup of buttermilk with one large egg. Whisk the two ingredients together.If you do not have buttermilk, you can whisk three eggs together. If you want to add a bit of creaminess to the mixture, you can add a dash of milk."
3155,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,5,A,A6,Make the crunchy coating for the slices.,"Again, there are several variations you can use for this part of the recipe. The most common is to use a ½ cup of cornmeal. Combine ¼ cup of flour with the ½ cup of cornmeal. Add one teaspoon of salt and a half teaspoon of pepper. Stir all of the ingredients together and set it aside.If you do not have cornmeal, you can use seasoned breadcrumbs (Italian or cracked pepper flavorings work well.) You could also crush up some crackers (Ritz work well) and set them aside in a bowl. The point is simply to add a bit of crunch to the fried tomatoes."
3156,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,6,A,A7,Pour ¼ cup of flour into a bowl.,"Lay the tomatoes slices in the flour, coating both sides evenly. Once you have done this, lay the flour-coated slices in the buttermilk and egg mixture, making sure they are fully coated in the liquid. Once coated in the egg mixture, dredge them in the cornmeal mixture (or whatever crunchy coating you chose to use.) Make sure they get a generous dipping in the crunchy concoction."
3157,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,7,A,A8,Fry the tomatoes.,Place each coated slice into the hot oil in the skillet. Make sure to give each tomato enough space or else they might fuse together while they are getting fried. Fry them for three minutes on each side. A good way to know when they are done is to watch them until they develop a golden brown color. until golden brown.
3158,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,8,A,A9,Remove them from the oil when they are golden brown.,"Use tongs to take each fried tomato out. Place them on a plate that has been covered with paper towels. The paper towels will absorb the grease that drips off of them, allowing them to become crunchy."
3159,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,9,A,A10,Serve with salt and pepper and enjoy!,Ranch also makes a great dipping sauce for these delicious fried treats.
3160,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,10,B,B1,"Pick out four firm, medium-sized green tomatoes.",These should be the same sort of tomatoes you would purchase for normal fried tomatoes. Slice the tomatoes into evenly sized discs. Generally cutting them into thirds or fourths work best.
3161,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,11,B,B2,Prepare a batter for your tomatoes.,"In a large bowl, combine one cup of flour, one tablespoon of cornstarch, and ¼ teaspoon of baking powder. You can also add any herbs you would like, as well as salt and pepper. Pour half a can of dark beer and a ½ cup of cold water into the dry mixture. Stir this mixture together.Dark beer such as a lager or an ale works best but if you only have lighter beers or ambers on hand, those should work fine as well."
3162,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,12,B,B3,Preheat oil in a heavy skillet.,"You should only pour about ½ an inch of oil into the skillet. The oil can either be vegetable oil or canola oil. Make sure the oil is fully heated by dropping a pinch of the batter into the oil. If it sizzles and immediately creates bubbles, the oil is perfectly heated."
3163,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,13,B,B4,Dip each slice of tomato in the batter.,"Make sure to coat both sides of the tomatoes evenly. Because the batter will be relatively thin and slippery, you will need to dip the tomatoes in and make sure they are coated really well."
3164,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,14,B,B5,Fry the tomatoes.,You will then need to transfer them immediately to the frying pan to ensure that none of the batter drips off. You should fry them for about three minutes or until they are golden brown.
3165,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,15,B,B6,Remove the tomatoes once they are golden brown.,Place them on a plate or pan that has been covered in paper towels. This will ensure that the excess oil drains off and the tomatoes become extra crispy.
3166,Make Fried Green Tomatoes,16,B,B7,Serve and enjoy.,Note that these are awesome when served with a dipping sauce like Ranch or marinara.
3167,Make Bolillos,0,none,1,Proof the yeast.,"Place 1/2 cup (125 ml) of warm water into a large bowl and add the yeast and sugar, stirring gently to mix the ingredients evenly. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 to 10 minutes, or until foam starts developing on the surface.If the yeast mixture does not become foamy, that means the yeast is dead or will otherwise not activate. As a result, the bread will not rise if you continue forward from here. If this happens, you should buy a new packet of yeast and start over.;"
3168,Make Bolillos,1,none,2,Add most of the remaining dough ingredients.,"Pour the remaining water into the yeast mixture, along with the oil, salt, and 2 cups (500 ml) of the all-purpose flour. Stir the contents of the bowl together using a wooden mixing spoon until evenly combined.If you have an electric stand mixer with a dough hook attachment, you could mix the dough ingredients together using that instead. The electric mixer can also help you knead the dough in future steps. Do not add all the flour at once, since doing so would make the dough harder to form. Add it in gradually, bit by bit."
3170,Make Bolillos,3,none,4,Add the rest of the flour.,"Gradually add the remaining 3 cups (750 ml) of all-purpose flour into the bowl. Add roughly 1 cup (250 ml) at a time and stir well after each addition. Continue until all the flour has been mixed in.   Note that, as the dough gets thicker and tougher, you might find it more difficult to stir it using your wooden mixing spoon. Should this happen, lightly dust your hands with flour and begin mixing the dough using your hands. You can also put flour on the sides of the bowl to prevent it from sticking. If you have been mixing the dough with a stand mixer and dough hook, you will not need to blend the remaining flour in by hand."
3171,Make Bolillos,4,none,5,Knead the dough.,"Lightly flour a clean kitchen counter. Turn the dough out of the bowl and onto this surface, and knead it for 5 minutes or so.You can also add a little bit of warm water right at the beginning of the kneading process.When ready, the dough should lose most of its stickiness and should be much firmer and smoother. If you have not done so already, lightly dust your hands with flour as you work with the dough. Dust your kneading surface with flour, too."
3172,Make Bolillos,5,none,6,Let the dough rise until doubled in size.,"Place the dough into a large, lightly oiled bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Set it aside in a warm location and let it rise for about 1 hour.The bowl you use should be roughly twice the original size of your batch of dough. Make sure that the bowl has a thin coat of vegetable oil or nonstick cooking spray along the bottom and sides before you put the dough inside. This oil should be enough to prevent the dough from sticking as it rises. You can cover the bowl with a clean, damp dish towel if you do not have plastic wrap."
3173,Make Bolillos,6,none,7,Punch down and knead the dough.,"Use your fists to gently deflate the risen dough. Lightly flour your kitchen counter again, and turn the dough out onto it. Knead the dough for another 2 minutes.   Note that you may also need to sprinkle your hands with flour again, especially if the dough threatens to stick to your fingers when you touch it."
3174,Make Bolillos,7,none,8,Separate the dough into pieces.,"Start by splitting the dough into three even portions. Further divide each of these three portions into four equal pieces, forming a total of 12 evenly sized rolls.   Alternatively, if you want to make more servings, you could split the full amount of dough into four equal sections. Split each of these portions into even fours, creating a total of 16 rolls."
3175,Make Bolillos,8,none,9,Form an oval.,"Roll one portion of dough in between your hands to form a roll. Place it on the counter, and gently flatten it into an oval using your fingers.   The oval should be about 1/2 inch to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) thick. Position the oval so that the long side runs from top to bottom and the shorter side runs from side to side."
3176,Make Bolillos,9,none,10,Fold each roll into thirds.,"Bring the bottom third of the oval up and over the center. Fold the top third of the oval over these two layers. Pinch the ends together into a blunt point. This process is similar to folding a piece of paper to fit in an envelope.Essentially, you need to fold each oval of dough in the same way you would fold a letter when placing it into a standard envelope."
3177,Make Bolillos,10,none,11,Arrange the rolls on a baking sheet.,"Place each uncooked roll on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Keep the seam side down, and space the rolls at least 2 inches (5 cm) apart.   Instead of parchment paper, you could use a silicone baking mat. Consider sprinkling the parchment paper or silicone sheet with a little extra cornmeal for added texture."
3178,Make Bolillos,11,none,12,Cover and let rise again.,"Place a loose sheet of plastic wrap over the baking sheet and move the dough to a warm location. Let the rolls rise for 30 minutes, or until roughly doubled in volume again."
3181,Make Bolillos,14,none,15,Brush each roll with the wash. Dip a pastry brush into the wash.,Carefully brush a bit of the wash over the tops and sides of each roll.   Wait until the rolls have finished rising before brushing them with the wash.
3182,Make Bolillos,15,none,16,Slash each roll lengthwise.,"Use a sharp, pointed knife to make a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) slash from one end of each roll to the other.Stop 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) from each end of each roll.   After making the slash, gently pinch the ends of each roll again to accentuate the point."
3184,Make Bolillos,17,none,18,Bake for 25 minutes.,"Place the baking sheet on the center rack of your preheated oven. Bake them until they turn a pale golden brown.Baking time might vary based on the strength of your oven and the size of your rolls. Be careful as you move the uncooked rolls into the oven. If you are too reckless or quick, you might cause them to deflate slightly. Note that the finished rolls will also have a ""hollow"" sound if you gently tap them on the bottom with your fingertip."
3185,Make Bolillos,18,none,19,Let cool on a wire rack.,Remove the baked rolls from the oven. Slip them off the baking sheet and place them on a wire cooling rack to cool.
3186,Make Bolillos,19,none,20,Enjoy your bolillos as dinner rolls or sandwiches.,"The bolillos are ready to eat once they are cool enough to handle with your hands. Eat them alongside a meal as a dinner roll. You could also slice them in half lengthwise and use the crusty bread halves for sandwiches.   If you want to save the rolls, do so by placing them in an airtight container. Store them at room temperature for up to three days."
3189,Make Hermit Slices,2,none,3,"Combine the flour, spices, salt, and baking soda.","Add 1 ½ cups (360 g) of all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons (5 g) of ground cinnamon, ¾ teaspoon (4 g) of salt, ½ teaspoon (2 ½ g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground ginger, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of nutmeg to a medium size bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully mixed, and set aside.If you want even spicier hermit slices, you can also add ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground cloves."
3191,Make Hermit Slices,4,none,5,Mix in the egg.,"Once the brown sugar and butter mixture is light and fluffy, add 1 large egg to the bowl. Continue beating the mixture on medium-high until the egg is fully incorporated and the mixture is smooth, which should take approximately 2 minutes.Once again, be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl occasionally as you beat the egg into the brown sugar and butter so the mixture is fully blended."
3193,Make Hermit Slices,6,none,7,Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture.,"Once all of the wet ingredients are combined, turn the hand mixer speed down to low and gradually begin adding the dry ingredients. Blend the dough until the dry ingredients are just incorporated.Be careful not to overmix the dough. If you do, you may end up with tough cookies."
3195,Make Hermit Slices,8,none,9,Divide the dough and roll it into logs.,"When the dough is fully mixed, separate it into two equal pieces. Place them on a floured surface, and roll them each into a log that’s approximately 14-inches by 2-inches (36-cm by 5-cm).You can also shape the dough into two 12-inch by 2-inch (30-cm by 5-cm) rectangles if you prefer."
3196,Make Hermit Slices,9,none,10,Place the logs on the cookie sheet and shape them.,"When you’ve formed the dough into logs, carefully transfer them to the lined baking sheets. Use your hands to gently square off the ends of the logs."
3197,Make Hermit Slices,10,none,11,Bake the logs until they are firm.,"Place the baking sheets with the logs in the preheated oven. Allow them to bake for 20 to 30 minutes or until the edges are firm.To ensure that the logs bake evenly, rotate the cookie sheets halfway through the baking process."
3200,Make Hermit Slices,13,none,14,Brush the glaze over the logs and allow them to cool completely.,"When the logs come out of the oven, use a pastry brush to apply it all over them. Once the glaze is applied, let the logs cool for at least 20 minutes.Applying the glaze while the logs are still warm allows them to absorb the glaze more easily."
3203,Make Venison Jerky,1,none,2,Mix together all ingredients for the marinade.,Place in an easily poured container.
3204,Make Venison Jerky,2,none,3,Pour the marinade over the meat.,"Leave to marinate overnight in the refrigerator. Either place it into a container with a lid, or Ziploc bags work just as well.   The venison pieces should all be cut the same thickness, with the standard being a 1/4 inch (6.35mm).This ensures that the venison jerky pieces will all cook evenly at the same time. In line with USDA advice, consider steaming or cooking the venison to 160ºF (70C) before dehydrating it."
3205,Make Venison Jerky,3,none,4,Remove the venison pieces from the fridge.,Drain well.
3206,Make Venison Jerky,4,none,5,Preheat the oven at a very low setting of around 200ºF (95C).,"Place the meat strips either directly onto the oven racks (line the base of the oven with foil to catch splatters), or placed on a cooling rack sitting on a cookie sheet brushed lightly with vegetable oil. Another neat alternative is to pierce each piece of venison with a toothpick and hang it from the upper rack of the oven.Place in the oven and leave to dry. This will take about 4 to 6 hours. If you've laid the jerky flat on a cookie sheet, it's important to turn the jerky about halfway, to ensure that it dries evenly. Otherwise, if it's hanging or sitting over the rack, it's good to stay. It's a good idea to leave the door open just a few inches or centimetres to allow the moisture to escape."
3207,Make Venison Jerky,5,none,6,Remove from the oven once dehydrated.,Leave to cool completely before placing into airtight storage; there should be no moisture present at all. Consume within 1–2 months.
3208,Make Venison Jerky,6,none,7,Use the microwave rather than the oven if preferred.,"After marinating the strips, hang over a microwave roasting rack. Set the microwave oven to high. Cook for 4–6 minutes. For every half a minute after 4 minutes, stop the oven and check the consistency and color of the jerky. When it changes from brown to dark brown and looks like jerky (leathery), it's ready.;"
3209,Make Venison Jerky,7,none,8,Store as outlined above.,
3210,Make Italian Ice,0,none,1,Chop the fruit.,"Wash the fruit and chop it into large chunks. Remove any peels, pits, or stems. You can do a single fruit flavor or combine several fruits to make a mixed fruit Italian ice.Choose the freshest and ripest fruit you can find for the most flavorful Italian ice.;"
3211,Make Italian Ice,1,none,2,Blend your ingredients.,"Place the chopped fruit, sugar or honey, lemon juice, and 2 cups of the ice into a blender or food processor. Cover the machine and blend your ingredients until they're totally smooth. Add the remaining cup of ice and completely blend it into the mixture.If you don't like seeds, consider straining the mixture through a mesh strainer."
3212,Make Italian Ice,2,none,3,Try making a syrup base.,"If you don't want to use a fruit puree as a base for your Italian ice, make a syrup that you can freeze. Combine 3 cups of water with 1 1/2 cups of sugar in a saucepan. Heat the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Then stir in 1/2 cup of lime or lemon juice. Refrigerate the mixture until it's cool.To quickly cool the syrup before you freeze it, fill a large bowl with ice. Set the bowl that has your hot syrup on top of the ice in the larger bowl. Leave it there for 15 minutes till it's cooler."
3213,Make Italian Ice,3,none,4,Consider making a different flavor.,"You don't always need to use a fruit puree base to make an Italian ice. You can try making a fruit juice lemon ice for something even lighter. Or, melt chocolate and let it cool before blending it with ice to make a chocolate Italian ice. Popular Italian ice flavors include:   Peach Lime Orange Lemon Coconut pineapple Raspberry"
3214,Make Italian Ice,4,none,5,Pour the mixture into a shallow pan.,"Fill a long shallow pan with the Italian ice puree. Using a long shallow pan (like a 9x13 baking dish) will help the mixture freeze faster. It will also make it easier to scrape or mix in a machine. Cover the pan with plastic wrap to prevent the Italian ice from absorbing smells from your freezer.If you want the mixture to freeze even faster, place the shallow pan in the freezer before you start making your Italian ice puree. This way, the pan will already be cold."
3215,Make Italian Ice,5,none,6,Freeze the mixture and scrape it.,"Traditionally, you should freeze the Italian ice for 30 minutes before scraping through the mixture with a fork. The mixture will be slushy. Freeze it again for another 2 hours until the mixture is firm. This will a crystallized Italian ice that you can serve.If you used a syrup base instead of the puree, you'll need to freeze the mixture longer before initially scraping. Freeze it for 1 1/2 hours, scrape the mixture with a fork, and then freeze it for another 1 1/2 hours before serving."
3216,Make Italian Ice,6,none,7,Blend the mixture for smoother Italian ice.,"If you don't want a crystallized Italian ice, you can use hand mixer with beater attachments. To do this, freeze your mixture in a long shallow pan (like a 9x13 baking dish). Once frozen, remove the mixture and put it in a blender. Cover the blender with the lid and pulse the blender until the mixture is shaved. This will make a lighter Italian ice.If you don't have a blender, transfer the frozen mixture to a large bowl. Use a hand mixer with beater attachments to blend the mixture until it's as smooth as you want it."
3217,Make Italian Ice,7,none,8,Consider using an ice cream maker.,"If you don't want to watch the Italian ice and scrape it periodically, you can also freeze it in an ice cream or gelato maker. This freezing method is hands off and will make a much smoother Italian ice. Pour the cold pureed mixture into your machine and follow the manufacturer's instructions.You should still be around when freezing the Italian ice in the ice cream maker. Most ice cream makers should only be run for about 20 to 30 minutes. If you run your machine too long, the frozen mixture will start to melt."
3218,Make Italian Ice,8,none,9,Serve the Italian ice.,"Scoop the Italian ice into cones or small bowls. If you'd like to drink the Italian ice as it melts, you may want to serve it in a tall glass with a straw. You can also add an optional garnish to show what flavor it is. You can garnish with:   Sliced strawberry Lemon or lime wedge Thin slice of watermelon Sliver of mango"
3220,Make Hoppers,1,A,A2,"Mix yeast, sugar, and warm water together.","Use 1/4 cup (60 mL) water heated to 110–115ºF (43–46ºC).Briefly stir in 1 tsp (5 mL) sugar and 1 tsp dry active yeast. Let sit for 5–15 minutes, until the mixture is foamy. The temperature and sugar causes the dry yeast to activate, turning the sugar into the flavors and airiness that make good hopper dough.   If you do not have a thermometer you can use for the water, use lukewarm or slightly warm water. Water that is too hot will kill the yeast, while water that is too cool will simply take longer to work. If your yeast mixture won't foam, you may be using old or damaged yeast. Try a new packet."
3221,Make Hoppers,2,A,A3,Add the yeast mixture to rice flour and salt.,"Once the yeast mixture is foamy, transfer it to a large bowl containing 3 cups (700 mL) rice flour and 1 tsp (5 mL) salt.Stir this together.   Use a bowl that can hold about 3 quarts (3 liters), since the batter will expand."
3222,Make Hoppers,3,A,A4,Add coconut milk to the mixture.,"Pour in 2.5 cups (640 mL) coconut milk and stir together until you have a smooth, consistent batter, with no lumps or color changes. You may puree this if you have a blender or food processor, but with this recipe it should be fairly easy to stir the batter by hand."
3223,Make Hoppers,4,A,A5,Cover the bowl and let rise.,"Now that the yeast is active, it will continue to ferment the sugars in the batter. This will make the batter expand into an airier mixture, and add additional flavor as well. Cover the bowl and let it sit on the counter for about 2 hours.The dough will expand to about twice its size by the time it's ready.Yeast works more quickly at warmer temperature, or if it is still relatively new. Check on it after an hour to see if the batter has already expanded enough."
3224,Make Hoppers,5,A,A6,Heat a pan over medium heat.,"If you have one, use a hopper pan, also called an appam pan, which has outward sloping sides that create hopper with a thin outer rim and a thicker center. Otherwise, a small wok or nonstick skillet will work.Heat it for about two minutes."
3225,Make Hoppers,6,A,A7,Add a small amount of oil to the pan.,"Two or three drops of oil should be enough for a single hopper. Twirl the pan to make sure the oil covers the sides, or use a cloth to apply it evenly.Some people prefer not to use any oil at all, but it helps prevent your hopper from sticking to the pan."
3226,Make Hoppers,7,A,A8,Add a ladle-full of batter and swirl it around the pan.,"Add roughly 1/3 cup (80 mL) of batter to the pan. Immediately tilt the pan and move it in a circular motion so the batter covers the sides and base of the pan. A thin, lacy layer of batter should stick to the sides, with a thicker layer in the center.   If the batter is too thick and won't leave the center of the pan when you twirl, stir 1/2 cup (120 mL) coconut milk or water into the batter before making your next hopper."
3227,Make Hoppers,8,A,A9,Crack an egg over the center of the hopper (optional).,"If you like, crack an egg directly over the center of the hopper. You might want to taste your first hopper plain first before you decide whether you'd like to try it with eggs. If each person is eating several hoppers, an egg for every hopper is probably too much. Consider 0-2 per person depending on their preference."
3228,Make Hoppers,9,A,A10,Cover and cook until the edges brown.,"Cover the pan with a lid and let the hopper cook for 1–4 minutes, depending on temperature and batter consistency. The hopper is ready when the edges are brown and the center is no longer runny, although you can leave them in longer for a crisper, golden-brown center if you prefer."
3229,Make Hoppers,10,A,A11,Remove from the pan carefully.,"A butter knife or other thin, flat utensil is good for removing the thin, crispy edge from the pan without breaking it. Once it's unstuck, use a spatula to transfer the hopper onto a plate. You can stack hoppers on top of each other as you cook them. If you are making a large number of hoppers (double or triple recipe) and want to keep them warm, place them in the oven at minimum temperature settings or with just the pilot light on."
3230,Make Hoppers,11,A,A12,Cook remaining batter the same way.,Grease the pan lightly between each hopper and cook each hopper in the covered pan until brown. Adjust the amount of batter you use if the hoppers are too thick to cook properly or too small to create the lacy edge around the pan sides.
3231,Make Hoppers,12,A,A13,Serve hot for breakfast or dinner.,"They are excellent for balancing out spicy curries or sambols. Because of the coconut flavor, they pair especially well with dinner dishes containing coconut."
3234,Make Hoppers,15,B,B3,Soak the uncooked rice in water for at least 4 hours.,"Use 1.5 cups of rice (350 mL).While you may be used to rice that doesn't require soaking, this recipe calls for blending the rice with other ingredients, so you'll need to soak it until it is soft enough to grind or put in a food processor."
3235,Make Hoppers,16,B,B4,Drain out the water from the soaked rice.,"Strain the soaked rice through a mesh or cloth to drain the water, leaving softened but uncooked rice."
3236,Make Hoppers,17,B,B5,"Grind the strained rice, cooked rice, and 3/4 cup (180 mL) grated coconut together.","This will take a lot of work by hand, so use a blender or food processor if you have one. Blend the uncooked rice along with the grated coconut and cooked rice to a smooth or nearly smooth batter. A slightly coarse or grainy texture is fine.Add water little by little to the batter if it looks dry or you're having trouble grinding it."
3237,Make Hoppers,18,B,B6,Mix 1/4 cup (60 mL) batter with 3/4 (180 mL) water.,"Stir the batter together to get a wetter, thinner mixture. Use a cooking pot or other cooking container. You'll cook this mixture and use it to start the batter fermenting, which adds air and flavor to the hoppers."
3240,Make Hoppers,21,B,B9,Cover and let sit for 8 hours.,"Cover the batter mixture with a cloth or lid and let it sit at room temperature. Often, people will leave it overnight and make hoppers for breakfast in the morning.   The batter should nearly double in size, and appear bubbly."
3241,Make Hoppers,22,B,B10,Add remaining ingredients to the batter.,"Once the batter is ready, add 1 tsp (5 mL) salt and 2 tsp (10 mL) sugar, or according to taste. Add either 1/4 tsp (1.2 mL) baking soda or a splash of toddy, also known as palm wine. Toddy has a strong flavor, so you may want to start with as little as 1 tsp (5 mL) and increase the amount if the first hopper doesn't have a distinct sour flavor.   Toddy is alcoholic, but the small amount used in this recipe should not affect sobriety."
3242,Make Hoppers,23,B,B11,Dilute the batter until it is easily poured.,"The batter should be thinner than American pancake batter. Add water or coconut milk until it is thin enough to easily swirl round the pan, but thick enough to stay together and not become entirely liquid. Stir or blend until there are no lumps."
3243,Make Hoppers,24,B,B12,Grease and heat a pan over medium heat.,"Use a cloth or paper towel to rub a small amount of oil across a hopper pan, wok, or skillet to lightly grease it. Heat for a couple minutes over medium heat; the pan doesn't need to get too hot.   Small pans with wide, sloping sides work best."
3244,Make Hoppers,25,B,B13,Use a ladle to add enough batter to coat your pan.,"Depending on the size of your pan, you'll need about 1/4–1/2 cups of batter (60–120 mL). Tilt the pan and run the batter along the edges in a circle once or twice. A thin layer should be left along the sides, with a thicker center at the base of the pan."
3245,Make Hoppers,26,B,B14,Cover with a lid and cook 2–4 minutes.,"Keep an eye on the hopper. It is ready when the edges are brown and the center is soft but not runny. It may be cooked a minute or two longer if you want the center to be crisp, but many prefer to eat it with a white center. Use a spatula to transfer it to a plate once it's done."

3271,Make Peruvian Fish Ceviche,0,none,1,Puree the base.,"Place the lime juice, garlic cloves, cilantro, habenero, and red onion in a blender. Add 3 large ice cubes. Blend the ingredients until they are completely smooth.   If you want the sauce to be as smooth as possible, you can strain it through a fine-mesh sieve.       If you struggle to get the ingredients to blend, add a little water to loosen them up.      ;"
3272,Make Peruvian Fish Ceviche,1,none,2,Add the fish juice.,"Once the ingredients are pureed and strained, add the fish or clam juice. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients well."
3273,Make Peruvian Fish Ceviche,2,none,3,Set the sauce aside.,Pour it into a bowl and cover it with a lid or a piece of plastic wrap. Place it in the refrigerator so that the flavors can begin to meld while you prepare the rest of the dish.
3274,Make Peruvian Fish Ceviche,3,none,4,Prepare the sweet potato.,"Place the sweet potato in a small pot and cover with cold water. Put a lid on the pot and place it on the stove over medium high heat. Boil the potato until the flesh gives easily when it's poked with a fork, then remove from heat and drain the water. Let the sweet potato cool, then peel it and chop the flesh into cubes.   Add as much or as little sweet potato as you want. You can also supplement it with corn and other vegetables.       For prettier presentation, use a melon baller to scoop the cooked flesh of the sweet potato. Set the balls aside."

3278,Make Fried Okra,0,A,A1,Heat the oil.,"Pour 1 qt (1 L) of vegetable oil into a deep, heavy-bottomed skillet. Set the skillet on the stove and allow the oil to heat to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).A cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven works best, but any skillet with a heavy bottom will suffice. You can also use an electric deep fryer. The oil should be at least 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep, if not a little deeper. Do not allow the oil to fill more than half the depth of the pan, however. Heat the oil over a medium-high heat setting, and adjust this setting as needed to maintain the temperature throughout the frying process. Check the temperature continually using a frying or candy thermometer.;"
3279,Make Fried Okra,1,A,A2,Rinse the okra.,"Place the okra in a colander and rinse it thoroughly under cool, running water. Afterward, allow the excess water to drip off by letting the okra sit in the colander for 30 to 60 seconds."
3280,Make Fried Okra,2,A,A3,Slice the okra.,"Using a sharp knife, slice the okra into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) pieces. Keep the pieces as uniform as possible."
3281,Make Fried Okra,3,A,A4,Combine the dry ingredients.,"Sift together the cornmeal, flour, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder. Whisk lightly until evenly combined.   These seasonings will create a traditional Southern flavor profile, but you can vary them based on personal preference. For instance, you could also add paprika, chili powder, or onion powder."
3282,Make Fried Okra,4,A,A5,Coat the okra with the eggs.,"Place the eggs in a medium bowl and beat them lightly using a whisk or fork. Toss the sliced okra in the beaten eggs, stirring until all sides are evenly coated.   If desired, you could use 3 to 4 egg whites instead of using 2 whole eggs. Doing so will make the final coating lighter and crispier in texture."
3283,Make Fried Okra,5,A,A6,Toss the okra into the dry ingredients.,"Working in half batches, lift the okra out of the egg and allow the excess to drain back into the bowl. Quickly toss the okra into the dry breading mixture, stirring to coat all sides.   Working in two batches instead of one will ensure a more even coating. Crowding the bowl, on the other hand, may create pockets of uneven coating."
3284,Make Fried Okra,6,A,A7,Fry the okra until golden brown.,"Toss the breaded okra into the hot oil and fry the pieces for 3 to 6 minutes, or until the breading turns golden brown.   Work in two or more batches while frying the okra. Stir the okra gently to prevent the pieces from sticking together and to ensure that all sides brown. Do not stir too quickly, however, since doing so could cause the breading to break off."
3285,Make Fried Okra,7,A,A8,Drain and serve.,"Using a slotted spoon, remove the finished okra from the hot oil and transfer the pieces to a plate covered with paper towels. Enjoy the fried okra after letting it drain for 30 to 60 seconds.   You can serve deep fried okra with additional salt and hot sauce."
3286,Make Fried Okra,8,B,B1,"Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).Meanwhile, prepare a shallow baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil.","Alternatively, you can also line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a light coating of nonstick cooking spray."
3288,Make Fried Okra,10,B,B3,Combine the dry ingredients.,"Place the cornmeal, flour, salt, pepper, and paprika in a medium mixing bowl. Toss the ingredients together with a whisk until evenly distributed.   You can vary the spices by personal taste, if desired. Other options worth considering may include cayenne pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, or chili powder."
3289,Make Fried Okra,11,B,B4,Drench the okra in buttermilk.,"Pour the buttermilk into a separate medium bowl. Toss the okra pieces into the buttermilk, stirring well to coat all sides.Allow the okra to sit for 20 to 30 seconds before continuing.   It's best to work in two or more batches to ensure a thorough coating. If you do not have buttermilk, you could use 2 lightly beaten eggs or 3 lightly beaten egg yolks instead."
3290,Make Fried Okra,12,B,B5,Toss the okra in the dry breading mixture.,"Remove the okra from the buttermilk, allowing the excess liquid to drip off and back into the bowl. Transfer the moist okra to the dry breading ingredients and toss to coat all sides.   As before, it's best to continue working in batches."
3291,Make Fried Okra,13,B,B6,Bake until golden brown.,"Spread the coated okra onto your prepared baking sheet in an even layer. Place the okra in the oven and roast it for about 30 minutes, or until the coating looks crispy and golden brown.   After approximately 15 minutes, gently flip and stir the okra with a spatula to promote even browning throughout."
3293,Make Fried Okra,15,C,C1,Clean the okra.,"Place the okra in a colander and rinse it under cool, running water. After removing the okra from the water, let the excess moisture drain for at least 30 seconds.   When stir-frying okra, it needs to be very dry. You may need to wipe it dry with clean paper towels before continuing."
3294,Make Fried Okra,16,C,C2,Slice the okra into strips.,"Cut off the head and tail of the okra, if necessary, and slice it down the center. Cut each lengthwise half into 1-inch (2.5-cm) pieces.   If you haven’t done so already, you should also cut up the onion and green chili pepper. The onion should be cut into thin slices, while the green chili pepper should be minced into small pieces."
3295,Make Fried Okra,17,C,C3,Heat the oil.,Pour 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of vegetable oil into a large skillet. Allow the oil to warm up on the stove over medium-high heat for approximately 30 seconds.
3296,Make Fried Okra,18,C,C4,Saute the onion and green chili pepper.,"Place the two ingredients in the hot oil. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 2 minutes or until the onions begin turning translucent.   You should also notice a stronger aroma coming from the onion and green chili pepper. This aroma signifies that the flavor of the two ingredients has been infused into the cooking oil."
3297,Make Fried Okra,19,C,C5,Add the okra and spices.,"Place the sliced okra in the pan alongside the onion and green chili. Sprinkle it with the salt, turmeric, and red chili pepper, then toss to combine."
3298,Make Fried Okra,20,C,C6,Stir-fry the okra.,"Cook the contents of the skillet, stirring frequently, for another 6 to 9 minutes.The okra should be cooked through after about 6 minutes, but it may retain a slimy texture. Cooking it for several more minutes should make it crispier. Note, however, that cooking the okra too long could cause it to lose much of its color and nutrients."
3299,Make Fried Okra,21,C,C7,Serve warm.,"Transfer the stir-fried okra to serving plates and enjoy it while it's still hot.   This recipe has its origins in Indian cuisine. Traditionally, it can be served with plain white rice and a sprinkle of lemon juice or dried mango powder. You can also serve it with flatbread and a dollop of plain yogurt."
3300,Make Chicken Taquitos,0,none,1,Cook the chicken.,"If you prefer to make potato or meat tacos then cook then whichever way you prefer. The same goes for chicken preparation--any which way is good.  Remove the skin from the chicken and cut it into pieces.        Put the water to boil in pot big enough to fit the chicken. Put the following ingredients into the pot: 2 spoons of salt, 1/2 an onion cut into chunks, 3 garlic cloves, 1 teaspoon of oregano, the chicken pieces. Leave the chicken in for about 20 minutes.       Take the chicken out of the pot and make sure it is cooked. If it is not put it back in for a few more minutes. Otherwise let the chicken cool.

3307,Pickle Onions,0,none,1,"Halve, peel, and slice the onion.","Red onions go great for this recipe; with their distinctive taste and deep red color, they actually turn pink after a couple days in the refrigerator.   You can slice the onions to the thickness you prefer — however thick, they'll still take the pickling solution. Some people prefer to cut the onions in a full moon, which makes them easy to grab with a fork; others prefer them smaller, cut them into half moons."
3308,Pickle Onions,1,none,2,Heat some water over the stove or in a kettle.,Heat enough water to completely submerge the sliced onion.
3309,Pickle Onions,2,none,3,"While the water begins to boil, toast the spices in a small pot.","Throw the cloves, cinnamon, chili, and thyme into a pot and toast them over medium-low heat until they become aromatic, about 3 - 5 minutes."
3310,Pickle Onions,3,none,4,"When the water is just about to boil, remove it from the heat and add the onions to the water.","Count to 10, and then strain the water and onions through a sieve.   Why parboil the onions? Parboiling removes a little bit of the acid zing from raw onions. You don't have to parboil if you like the zing of raw onions, but a slightly mellower onion makes the pickling juice really stand out."
3311,Pickle Onions,4,none,5,Transfer the onions from the sieve to the ice bath to stop them from cooking.,"You can let the onions rest there or remove them after 10 seconds. Onions which are left in the ice bath will continue to mellow while the sulfur compounds (the onion's natural defense) diffuse into the water.Once onions are done, drain them completely and place them into a container."
3312,Pickle Onions,5,none,6,"Add the vinegar, lime juice, and 1/4 cup of sugar to the toasted spices.","Turn on the burner to medium high and bring the pickling juice to a simmer, dissolving the sugar completely. Simmer for an additional minute."

3314,Pickle Onions,7,none,8,Enjoy.,"Try your pickles on homemade tacos, sandwiches with richer cuts of meat (like pork), or a hearty stew."
3315,Pickle Onions,8,none,9,Choose different spices for your pickling juice.,"The above spices are just one combination that works well together. There are lots of spices that work well in a pickling liquid for onions. Here are just a few:   Fresh whole garlic. A little goes a long way, but who doesn't like the combination of garlic and onion? Simply divine. Fresh ginger. Cuts through the acidity with its distinctive taste. Bay leaf. Dried bay leaf has a smoky, fresh complexity. Fresh herbs. Experiment with rosemary, oregano, marjoram, or tarragon, among many others. Juniper berries. Fruity, spicy, complex. These berries give gin their distinctive taste. Star anise. Great substitute for or addition to cloves. Mustard seed. This seed adds a bit of smoky tang to the onions.;"

3336,Cure Bacon,1,none,2,Chill your meat.,"If you purchased your pork belly from a commercial vendor other than a farm and plan on curing it as soon as you get home, skip this step, since the meat has already been chilled. But if you buy direct from a farm, ask the farmer how long ago the hog was slaughtered, because you need to chill your meat within 24 hours of that time.In either case, bring along a cooler stocked with ice to keep the pork belly relatively cool on the ride home if it takes you more than half an hour.Once home, place the pork belly in a sealable container to keep your fridge clean and prevent cross-contamination with other items. For a quicker chill, set the container inside the fridge wherever it is coldest. To further reduce the chance of cross-contamination, set it in the meat compartment, away from other products. Keep the refrigerator’s temperature at 40 degrees Fahrenheit and let the pork belly sit until its core temperature drops to 42 degrees, which will help kill bacteria. If you are chilling multiple bellies, set each one in its own container rather than stacking the meat directly on top of each other."
3337,Cure Bacon,2,none,3,Cut the skin off.,"Either ask your butcher to do it for you when you purchase the meat, or do it at home yourself. In the latter case, use a sharpened knife since the skin is tough. Begin your cut at any corner of the belly. As you slice the skin off, angle the blade toward the skin, rather than away from it, so you don’t end up trimming off any more precious meat than necessary. Once your skin is removed, the meat will absorb more of the cure.The discarded skin can be cooked on its own, either by grilling or deep-frying. If you wish to do this, be sure to tell your butcher to save the skin if you have them slice the skin off for you."
3339,Cure Bacon,4,none,5,Mix a basic cure.,"Exact recipes vary by personal taste and ingenuity. To cure 5 pounds of meat with a minimum of ingredients, first combine 1 cup of sugar with 2 tablespoons of blackstrap molasses in a bowl. Stir thoroughly. Then add 4 tablespoons of kosher salt, 2 teaspoons of curing salt, and 2 teaspoons of ground black pepper. Mix thoroughly, taste, and add more salt if desired.Even this basic recipe can be altered to suit your tastes by exploring the effects of different types of sugar, salt, and pepper."
3340,Cure Bacon,5,none,6,Try a saltier cure with sage and thyme.,"For roughly 5 pounds of meat, combine a ½ cup of kosher salt with 2 teaspoons of sodium nitrite. Mix in a ¼ cup of brown sugar (either dark or light is fine). Then add ⅛ cup of each of the following: ground black pepper, ground juniper berries, and crumbled sage. Finally, add 1 tablespoon of dried thyme. Stir all ingredients thoroughly for an even mix.   Both the sodium nitrite and juniper berries can be omitted if desired."
3341,Cure Bacon,6,none,7,Cure your bacon with honey.,"For every 5 pounds of meat, combine a ¼ cup of kosher salt with 2 teaspoons of pink curing salt. Then add a ¼ cup of dark brown sugar. Next, add spices: 2 tablespoons of red pepper flakes, 2 tablespoons of smoked sweet paprika, and 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds. Lastly, pour a ¼ cup of honey into the dry ingredients and stir them together until both wet and dry ingredients have been evenly mixed.Any honey will do, but chestnut honey works particularly well here."
3342,Cure Bacon,7,none,8,Rub the cure into the meat.,"Remove your chilled pork belly from the fridge. To keep your kitchen surfaces clean, place it on a rimmed baking sheet. Coat the meat with your cure recipe. Then massage the cure into the meat all over,doing your best to spread the cure over and into the pork belly as evenly as you can for consistent flavor."
3343,Cure Bacon,8,none,9,Refrigerate the pork belly.,"Once it has been coated with cure, place the meat into a sealable container. If you use a plastic bag for this, set the bag in a rimmed baking sheet or a pan to keep any possible leaks from spreading in your fridge. Refrigerate the pork belly for at least 5 days. As juices begin to pool at the bottom of the container, be sure to flip the pork belly daily so each side is more or less evenly soaked in brine.If your meat is particularly thick, or you wish to have as much cured flavor as possible, leave the pork belly to cure for 7 days to ensure that the cure makes its way to the middle of the meat, thus extending its shelf life."
3344,Cure Bacon,9,none,10,Rinse your meat.,Remove the pork belly from the fridge and its container. Place it in a colander. Run cold water over both sides to wash away all excess salt. Then use paper towels or a clean towel to gently pat the meat dry.Your bacon is now cured!
3345,Cure Bacon,10,none,11,Store your meat safely.,"If you do not cook and consume your bacon right away, wrap it with plastic wrap. Seal it tightly to keep out air.Store in your refrigerator or freezer.

3349,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,2,none,3,Cut the bones away from the roast.,"You may do this at home or ask your butcher to do it for you. Cutting the bones away from the roast, then tying them back on with kitchen twine will make the roast easier to carve the roast once it's cooked.Slide a sharp knife between the top edge of the bones and the meat. Carefully cut them from the roast. You may leave the ends attached if desired. Wrap a piece of kitchen twine under the bones and around the meat, and tie it tightly."
3351,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,4,none,5,Season the roast and bring it to room temperature.,"In order for the meat to cook evenly, it's necessary to remove it from the refrigerator and bring it to room temperature about 3 hours before you start cooking. Season it on both sides with salt and pepper. Place it on a large platter and cover it with plastic wrap, then set it on your kitchen counter."
3352,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,5,none,6,Place the roast in a roasting pan.,"Position it so the fat side is up, and the rib side is down. This way the drippings from the fat will help the meat become nice and juicy while it cooks. The pan you use should only be slightly bigger than the roast.   You'll need a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of the meat. If you have the type that should be inserted in the meat before cooking, go ahead and insert it, making sure the tip is not touching the bone."
3353,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,6,none,7,Preheat the oven to 200 degrees.,"Cooking the roast low and slow, so that the proper internal temperature is reached without overcooking the meat, will result in a tender, succulent interior. Don't worry - the final step of searing the meat will bring about the crunchy outer crust prime rib is known for."
3354,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,7,none,8,Roast the meat to your desired doneness.,"When the internal temperature is 115 to 120 °F (46 to 49 °C), the meat will be rare. If you prefer it medium, wait until it reaches 125 to 130 F. The cooking time depends on the shape and size of your roast, but as a general rule you should allow 15 minutes per pound. Check the thermometer often to make sure you don't overcook the meat.   Make sure the thermometer is not touching the bone, fat or the pan when you measure the temperature."
3355,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,8,none,9,Remove the roast from the oven when it has reached your desired temperature.,"Let it rest for 15 to 20 minutes while you heat the oven to a higher temperature to sear the meat.After this resting period, there will be no need to rest the meat again before serving."

3357,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,10,none,11,Place the roast back in the oven to sear the top.,"Leave it in the oven for 8-10 minutes, or until a brown, crispy crust has formed. When you're satisfied with the crust, remove the roast and prepare to carve it right away. Do not overcook the meat or allow it to burn."
3358,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,11,none,12,Carve the roast.,"Place the roast on a carving board. Cut and remove the string tying the bones to the meat, and set the bones aside. Carve the roast into 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) slices against the grain using a very sharp carving knife."
3359,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,12,none,13,Make gravy from the drippings.,"In a saucepan, heat up 2 tablespoons of the drippings. Add 2 tablespoons of flour and whisk until the gravy has thickened. Add the rest of the drippings and enough cream to make 1 or 2 cups of liquid, depending on how many people you're serving. Season the gravy with salt and pepper.   Beer, stock, or water may be added instead of cream."
3360,Prepare and Cook a Prime Rib Roast,13,none,14,Serve the roast.,"Ask your guests how well they would like their meat done. Meat near the edge will be more done than in the center slices.

3431,Make Fufu,0,A,A1,Boil the water.,"Corn fufu, also called ugali, is one of the many types of fufu that you can make. As the name suggests, it’s made by combining boiling water and corn, in the form of cornmeal.  Add the full amount of water to a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the salt, and bring the water to a boil over medium heat. When the water boils, remove 1 cup (237 ml) of the water and set it aside. Keep the rest of the water on the heat.;"
3432,Make Fufu,1,A,A2,Add the cornmeal and reduce the heat.,"Slowly pour the cornmeal into the pot of water, whisking constantly as you add it. Once all the cornmeal has been added and incorporated, switch to a wooden spoon and continue stirring the mixture.Once all the cornmeal has been stirred in, turn the heat to low."
3433,Make Fufu,2,A,A3,Stir constantly until the mixture thickens.,"Stir the cornmeal vigorously with the wooden spoon to prevent it from burning. If any lumps form, remove the pan from the heat momentarily to stir out the lumps, then return the pan to the heat.  As the mixture heats up, the starch in the cornmeal will thicken the mixture. This will take about five to 10 minutes. When the mixture is ready, it will start to smell like roasted corn."
3434,Make Fufu,3,A,A4,Add the remaining water.,"Once the fufu has thickened, add the reserved cup of water back into the pot. Stir to combine, then put the lid on the pot. Let the fufu cook for 10 to 15 minutes.When the cooking time is up, remove the pan from the heat."

3436,Make Fufu,5,B,B1,Gather your supplies.,"To make cassava and plantain fufu, you'll need a large pot for boiling the ingredients, plus a special large-scale pestle and mortar that you'll use to pound the fufu.  You'll also need a large saucepan, a knife, a bowl, and a ladle or small bowl. If you don’t have a large pestle and mortar, you can use a smaller scale one and work in very small batches to make single-serving fufu."
3437,Make Fufu,6,B,B2,Peel and cut the cassava and plantain.,"Peel the plantain and cut it into one-inch (2.5-cm) chunks. Cut the cassava into one-inch (2.5-cm) disks. Peel each disk, and then chop the disks into cubes.  It’s important to use sweet cassava instead of bitter, because bitter cassava requires a different processing method to remove all the harmful cyanogenic glycosides present in the root.You can substitute yam for the plantain and cassava in this recipe to make yam fufu. Just make sure you use yam, which has white flesh and brown skin, and not sweet potato, which is sometimes mistakenly called yam."
3438,Make Fufu,7,B,B3,Boil the cassava and plantain.,"Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat. When the water is boiling, add the cassava and plantain chunks and bring the water back to a boil.  Boil the cassava and plantain for about 15 minutes, or until you can easily insert a knife into the flesh."
3439,Make Fufu,8,B,B4,Drain the water.,"When the cassava and plantain are cooked and soft, strain them and reserve the water. Either use a slotted spoon to remove the chunks, or place a strainer over a large bowl to catch the water when you strain the chunks.  The water you used to boil the cassava and plantain now contains starches from both, and you'll use this later to help bring the fufu together."
3440,Make Fufu,9,B,B5,Mash the plantain.,"Add the plantain to the mortar one piece at a time. Mash each piece a couple times with the pestle to break down the larger chunks before adding another piece. Repeat until all the plantain pieces have been mashed into a chunky pulp. Continue pounding, and start folding the plantain dough over on itself in between each pound so that you remove all the smaller chunks as well.When the plantain is ready, you'll have a smooth dough that’s free of chunks. Remove the plantain dough from the mortar and place it in a separate bowl. It’s easier to work the large pestle and mortar with two people, where one person concentrates on pounding with the pestle and the other person manages the ingredients in the mortar."
3441,Make Fufu,10,B,B6,Mash the cassava.,"Repeat the same process with the cassava. Pound one piece at a time until all the cassava has been mashed. Then fold the dough between each pound to remove all the small chunks.  When the cassava is ready, it will have the appearance of a smooth, white dough."
3442,Make Fufu,11,B,B7,Combine the doughs.,"Return the plantain dough to the mortar. Pound the doughs together with the pestle, folding the dough between each pound to fully incorporate the plantain and cassava.  If the dough starts to stick, add the reserved starch water in ¼ cup (60-ml) increments. The fufu is ready when the two doughs have been fully incorporated and the fufu is soft and fluffy."
3443,Make Fufu,12,B,B8,Form into balls before serving.,Use a ladle or small bowl to portion out the fufu. Work each fufu portion in your hands to form it into a doughy ball before serving.
3444,Make Fufu,13,C,C1,Boil the water.,"In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, bring the water to a boil over medium heat. It’s important to use a heavy saucepan, because this will help prevent the fufu from burning as it cooks and thickens.  If you don’t have access to ground semolina and ground rice, you can substitute 2 cups (454 g) each of ready-made baking mix (such as Bisquick) and instant mashed potatoes, plus 2 cups (244 g) of cassava or tapioca flour."
3445,Make Fufu,14,C,C2,Add the semolina.,"Slowly pour the semolina into the water, whisking constantly as you do. Once all the semolina has been incorporated, switch to a wooden spoon. Stir constantly for three to four minutes, giving the mixture time to thicken.  Fufu made in a pot can get quite thick, so you may need to get someone to help you hold the pot while you stir."
3446,Make Fufu,15,C,C3,Add the rice.,"Slowly pour the ground rice into the mixture as well, stirring constantly to mix all the ingredients. When all the rice has been stirred in, put on the lid, lower the heat, and let the fufu cook for 10 minutes."
3447,Make Fufu,16,C,C4,Serve hot.,"Use a ladle to portion out the fufu, and serve it fresh and hot with your favorite soups and stews."
3448,Make Sausage Balls,0,none,1,Combine the ingredients.,"Place the baking mix, pork sausage, and cheddar cheese in a large mixing bowl. Use your hands to mix the ingredients until evenly combined.   Regular or mild pork sausage works well for these, but if desired, you could alter the flavor slightly by using hot sausage or Italian seasoned sausage. If you don't want to mix the ingredients by hand, place them into the bowl of a stand mixer and combine them using the paddle attachment at low speed. Note that the resulting dough will be crumbly, but it should hold together when pressed.;"
3449,Make Sausage Balls,1,none,2,Roll the dough into balls.,"Use your hands to roll the dough into 1-inch or 1-1/2-inch (2.5-cm or 3.75-cm) balls. Place the balls 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart on a prepared baking sheet or plate.   As you grab the dough, squeeze the mixture in between your hands to help press and hold it together. Gently roll each portion in between the palms of your hands until it forms a ball. Alternatively, use a melon-baller or small cookie scoop to portion and shape the dough quicker. You can cook the sausage balls immediately using either the oven or stovetop. Note that you can also cover and store them in the refrigerator for 24 hours or the freezer for up to one month."
3450,Make Sausage Balls,2,none,3,Combine the dry ingredients.,"Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Mix until evenly combined."
3451,Make Sausage Balls,3,none,4,Cut in the butter.,"Add the butter or shortening to the dry ingredients, then cut it into the ingredients until the mixture takes on the consistency of coarse crumbs.   Adding the butter in small chunks could make it easier to cut in. Use a fork or pastry blender to mash and slice the butter into the dry ingredients."
3452,Make Sausage Balls,4,none,5,Add the ground sausage.,"Use your hands to mix the sausage into the other ingredients. Continue mixing until everything seems evenly distributed.   Nearly any type of ground sausage will work for this recipe. Use pork sausage for the most traditional flavor or turkey sausage for a healthier alternative. You can stick with mild sausage or use seasoned (hot or Italian) sausage. Mixing the dough with your hands will be the quickest, most thorough method, but if you prefer to keep your hands clean, place the mixture in the bowl of a stand mixer and combine on low speed using the paddle attachment."
3453,Make Sausage Balls,5,none,6,Work the cheeses into the mixture.,"Add the cream cheese and shredded cheddar cheese to the sausage mixture. Use your hands to thoroughly work both cheeses into the dough.   Note that the cream cheese must be softened before you add it to the mixture. Cold cream cheese will be harder to spread. Consider working the cream cheese into the mixture before adding the shredded cheddar. You can add both at the same time, but doing so may make it slightly harder to evenly distribute the cream cheese."
3454,Make Sausage Balls,6,none,7,Roll the dough into balls.,"Use your hands to form the sausage into 1-inch (2.5-cm) balls. Place the balls onto a prepared baking sheet or plate.   The dough should hold together fairly well, but if it seems a little crumbly, squeeze each portion in between your palms to help press it together. Roll the dough into balls immediately after doing so. For a faster, cleaner alternative, you can use a cookie scoop or melon-baller to form the balls instead of using your hands. Cook the sausage balls immediately after forming them or cover and store them until later. When stored in airtight containers, the sausage balls should hold for 24 hours in the refrigerator or one month in the freezer. Note that both the oven and stovetop cooking methods can be used for this recipe."
3457,Make Sausage Balls,9,none,10,Roll the dough into balls.,"Roll portions of the dough in between the palms of your hands, forming 1-inch to 1-1/2-inch (2.5-cm to 3.75-cm) balls. Place the balls on a prepared baking sheet or large plate.   If the dough seems crumbly, gently press each portion in between your palms before rolling it into a ball. Doing so should help the ingredients hold together more effectively. A cookie scoop or melon-baller could also be used to form the balls if you do not wish to form them by hand. You can cook the sausage balls immediately or cook them later. Cover and store uncooked sausage balls in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours, or in your freezer for up to one month. When you're ready to cook them, both the oven and stovetop cooking methods will work."
3458,Make Sausage Balls,10,none,11,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).,"Prepare one or two baking sheets by lining them with nonstick aluminum foil.   If you don't have nonstick aluminum foil, you can coat the baking sheet with parchment paper, nonstick cooking spray, or a silicone baking mat. When arranging the sausage balls on this prepared baking sheet, space them roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart to prevent them from baking together."
3459,Make Sausage Balls,11,none,12,Bake until lightly browned.,"Place the sausage balls in the preheated oven and bake until the bottoms are lightly browned. This should take 20 to 30 minutes.   The baking mix and reduced-calorie sausage balls will usually take between 20 and 25 minutes, but the scratch sausage balls may take up to 30 minutes. If you're using standard aluminum foil or ungreased parchment paper, use a spatula to turn the sausage balls halfway through the cooking time. Doing so may prevent them from sticking. To cook frozen sausage balls, allow them to thaw in the refrigerator for 12 hours before baking or bake them for an additional 5 to 10 minutes."
3460,Make Sausage Balls,12,none,13,Serve warm.,"Remove the sausage balls from the oven and cool for approximately 5 minutes. Pierce each one with a toothpick and serve as appetizers or snacks.   If desired, sprinkle the sausage balls with chopped fresh parsley before serving. You can enjoy the sausage balls plain or with your favorite dip. Consider serving them with grape jelly, a mustard-mayonnaise dip, or barbecue sauce."
3461,Make Sausage Balls,13,none,14,Preheat a large skillet.,Spray a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and set it on your stove over medium heat.   Allow the pan spray to warm up for roughly 30 seconds before continuing.
3462,Make Sausage Balls,14,none,15,Cook half the balls until browned.,"Place half of the sausage balls in the warm skillet and cook for 15 to 17 minutes or until done.   Turn the sausage balls frequently using a heat-resistant spatula to prevent them from sticking. Note that you'll need to cook the sausage balls in batches. If you crowd the skillet, the balls may stick together or may not cook evenly."
3463,Make Sausage Balls,15,none,16,Cook the remaining half.,"Set aside the cooked sausage balls and cook the remaining half in the warm skillet for another 15 to 17 minutes, or until browned.   Before cooking the second half, transfer the first half to a shallow baking pan, arranging them in a single layer. Keep them warm while the remaining sausage balls finish cooking."
3464,Make Sausage Balls,16,none,17,Serve warm.,"Pierce the finished sausage balls with toothpicks and enjoy them as appetizers or snacks.   Sprinkle the finished sausage balls with chopped parsley before serving, if desired. You can serve the sausage balls plain or enjoy them with a dip. Grape jelly, mustard, and barbecue sauce are popular options."
3465,Smoke a Turkey,0,none,1,Remove any organs that may be in the turkey's cavity.,"If buying a frozen turkey, there's a good chance that your turkey contains a few extra organs — kidney, liver, heart, gizzard — in the cavity of the turkey. Remove and set aside.   A good idea for the leftovers is to incorporate them into your stuffing recipe. Sauté them in a bit of butter or oil and add sparingly to most stuffing recipes for added flavor. Many people choose to make broth or stock from the innards of the turkey. Cut them up, along with a diced onion, a couple carrots, as well as a couple stalks of celery, and add to a pot of boiling water. Add a bit of salt, peppercorns, and several bay leaves to the pot and boil for several hours, skimming the foam off the top every so often.;"
3466,Smoke a Turkey,1,none,2,Rinse the turkey.,Run water inside and outside the turkey to clean it. Pat it dry or let it air dry.
3467,Smoke a Turkey,2,none,3,Decide whether to brine the turkey (optional).,"A brine is a bath of flavored salt water that you soak your bird in for 24 hours before smoking. Brining your turkey will add extra flavor and help it stay moist during the cooking process.Here is a basic brine recipeyou can try for your turkey:   Bring 2 gallons (7.6 L) of water to a boil in a large saucepan. To it, add 4 cups of salt, 4 cups of sugar, one bulb of garlic (cut in half), a cup of black peppercorns, and your choice of fresh herbs (thyme, rosemary, lavender, sage, and marjoram all work well). Turn off heat and allow salt and sugar to dissolve completely. Let steep for 5 minutes. Add the basic brine to large cooler filled with 3 bags of ice, stirring. To the cooler, add 1 gallon (3.8 L) of apple cider, and four each lemons and oranges, sliced in half. Submerge your turkey in the cooler, making sure it is entirely covered with liquid. Let your bird soak for at least 24 hours, turning the turkey every 6 to 12 hours. Try to keep the cooler in a cold place; if the temperature of the brine goes above 40 °F (4 °C), add extra ice to keep the solution cool."
3468,Smoke a Turkey,3,none,4,Thaw your turkey completely.,"If you chose not to brine your turkey and you purchased a frozen one, you'll want to thaw it completely before smoking. Thawing a turkey in the refrigerator takes longest but is the safest method for completing the task. Place the turkey in a large bowl or pan and let it sit in the refrigerator for 1 day for every 5 pounds of bird.You can also thaw a turkey by covering it in cool water. Submerge the turkey in a sink full of cold water. It will need to stay in its cold water bath for 30 minutes for every pound of bird."
3469,Smoke a Turkey,4,none,5,"After thawing, cover the bird with a rub, a glaze, or basic seasoning.","Rub a generous amount of oil or butter over the entire bird. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and any other desired seasoning. Get creative!   A dry rub is a combination of dry spices that you rub into the skin of the turkey, coating it in flavor. For a basic but classic holiday rub, try a combination of kosher salt, pepper, dried thyme, dried rosemary, dried sage, and garlic powder.A glaze is a thick, usually syrupy mixture, that is brushed onto meat and which reduces once cooked, concentrating its flavors. Consider going with this holiday-themed glaze consisting of cranberry juice, maple syrup, apple cider, and brown sugar.Who says smoking a turkey needs to be fancy? Give basic seasoning a try. Coat the turkey liberally with oil or softened butter and rub salt and pepper over its skin. You're ready to cook."
3471,Smoke a Turkey,6,none,7,Prepare the grill rack of the smoker.,Oil the rungs of the rack or line it with foil to keep the bird from sticking..
3472,Smoke a Turkey,7,none,8,Light your smoker.,"Your optimum temperature for smoking a turkey is around 230 °F (110 °C), but anywhere between 220° and 240 °F (116 °C) is acceptable. It will take your smoker about 45 minutes to reach this temperature."
3473,Smoke a Turkey,8,none,9,Add your wood.,"Once the smoker is lit and pre-heated to be ready for cooking, add your pre-soaked wood chips to the smoker.   If you want, you can get fancy with your soaking liquids. Say, for example, you're using hickory chips to smoke the turkey. Why not reach for bourbon as your soaking liquid? Or say you're smoking with applewood chips. Why not reach for apple cider? Complement the flavor of the chips with a tasty soaking liquid. Experiment with different wood chips to alter the flavor of the meat. Milder flavors of wood chips include alder, apple, cherry, grape, maple, mulberry, orange, and peach; stronger flavors include hickory, mesquite, oak, pecan, walnut, and whiskey barrel.Some people prefer not smoking their wood chips — or wood chunks — at all.They argue that wood needs to dry out before it produces smoke, prolonging the process. Experiment for yourself whether smoking with soaked or dry wood chips produces better flavor."
3474,Smoke a Turkey,9,none,10,Place the turkey on the smoker.,"Place the turkey on the cooking rack of the smoker with the breast up. The best part of the rack to place the turkey will depend on where the most direct heat is. You'll want to place the turkey on the side of the rack, away from direct heat. Put the lid back on the smoker.   Consider placing a drip pan underneath the turkey. If you want to save fluids and fat for some smokey gravy, place a drip pan underneath your rack to catch any fluids leaving your turkey."
3475,Smoke a Turkey,10,none,11,Maintain the heat of the smoker at around 230 °F (110 °C).,"Check the smoker every hour or so to maintain the heat and smoke. Add more charcoal, wood chips or water as needed. If your smoker doesn't have a thermometer attached to it, consider placing a metal thermometer inside the cooking rack to gauge the temp when you open it."
3476,Smoke a Turkey,11,none,12,Time the cooking of your turkey by the poundage of the bird.,"Your turkey will need 30 to 40 minutes per pound to smoke. The time difference is determined by your smoker and the temperature outside.   At 220 °F (104 °C), a 15 lb turkey will take between 8 and 9 hours to smoke. If you decide to cook at a higher temperature, the cooking time will diminish significantly, but the turkey won't retain as much smoky flavor. At 325 °F (163 °C), a 15 pound turkey will take between 3 and 3.5 hours to smoke."
3477,Smoke a Turkey,12,none,13,Wait for the internal temperature of the turkey to reach 165 °F (74 °C) for doneness.,"Calculate the minimum time suggested that the turkey might take to smoke completely. When that amount of time has passed, open the lid and quickly get a reading with your meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh area of the bird. The turkey is done when the temperature is at 165 °F (74 °C).   If the turkey is not done yet, put the lid back on the smoker and let the bird cook another 30-45 minutes. Check for the desired temperature again."
3478,Smoke a Turkey,13,none,14,Let it rest.,"After removing the bird from the smoker, let it rest for around 30 minutes before carving. This will help the juices settle in the bird, making for a moister treat when you finally do cut into it."
3480,Make Hardees Biscuits,0,none,1,Preheat your oven and melt the butter.,"Turn your oven on to 450 F (232 C) and let it preheat while you prepare the biscuits.Place about 2 tablespoons (30 g) of butter into a glass bowl. Place the bowl on top of the oven so the butter will warm and melt over the heat from the oven.   Use a glass or metal bowl for the butter, as this will conduct heat better and allow the butter to melt. Also, a plastic bowl might melt from the heat of the oven. Melt the butter in the microwave or in a pot on the stove if your oven top doesn’t get hot enough to melt it.;"
3481,Make Hardees Biscuits,1,none,2,Sift together the dry ingredients.,"Position a large sifter over a large mixing bowl. Measure the sugar, self-rising flour, and baking powder, and pour them into the large sifter. Tap the side of the sifter with your hand to sift the dry ingredients into the bowl. This will remove lumps and help incorporate the three ingredients.   To make your own self-rising flour, combine 5 cups (625 g) of all-purpose flour, 7½ teaspoons (30 g) of baking powder, and 1¼ teaspoons (7.5 g) of salt."
3482,Make Hardees Biscuits,2,none,3,Rub in the shortening.,"Add the shortening to the bowl with the dry ingredients. With your fingers, rub the shortening into the flour. Continue mixing the ingredients together in this way until the dough takes on the texture of large crumbs.For a richer and flakier biscuit, you can use lard instead of vegetable shortening."
3483,Make Hardees Biscuits,3,none,4,Add the buttermilk and water.,"With your hand, make a well in the center of the dough. Pour the cold buttermilk and water into the well. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to combine the wet and dry ingredients. Stop as soon as the dough starts to come together.   The biscuit dough will be sticky, but resist the urge to keep stirring. Overmixing will develop the gluten and make for dense and chewy biscuits."
3484,Make Hardees Biscuits,4,none,5,Fold the dough.,"Turn the dough out onto a floured countertop or flat surface. Sprinkle some flour on top of the dough. Flatten the dough into a circle with your hands. Fold the left side of the dough into the center, and then the right side of the dough on top of that. Starting from the top, roll the dough into a pinwheel and shape it into a ball.   Flatten out the dough with your hands and repeat these same folding steps a second time.Folding the dough in this way will fully incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing the dough. Avoid kneading, which can also develop the gluten."
3485,Make Hardees Biscuits,5,none,6,Roll the dough.,"Roll the dough out with the rolling pin. Continue rolling until you have a one-inch (2.5-cm) thick circle. Make sure the dough is an even thickness, otherwise your biscuits will be different sizes.   Add more flour to the rolling pin and counter to prevent sticking."
3486,Make Hardees Biscuits,6,none,7,Cut the dough.,"Use a floured 2-inch (5-cm) round cookie cutter to punch out as many biscuits as possible.When you can't get any more biscuits, collect the dough scraps. Shape them into a ball and roll out the leftover dough. Cut out as many biscuits as you can.   Repeat until there's no longer enough dough for more biscuits."
3487,Make Hardees Biscuits,7,none,8,Brush the tops with butter.,"Transfer the biscuits to the baking sheet. Position them side by side so they're all just touching. Take your pastry brush and brush the tops of the biscuits with the melted butter that’s been warming on the oven.Brushing the tops with butter will add a bit of a salty kick to the biscuits, and help them become a nice golden brown when they bake."
3488,Make Hardees Biscuits,8,none,9,Bake the biscuits.,"Transfer the biscuits to the oven and bake them for 10 to 15 minutes. The biscuits are ready when they turn a light golden brown color. When they're done, remove them from the oven.   Set the baking sheet aside and let the biscuits cool for a few minutes."
3489,Make Hardees Biscuits,9,none,10,Cool the biscuits before serving.,"When the biscuits are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Set them aside until they're cool enough to eat, about 30 minutes.   Serve the biscuits plain, buttered, with jam or cream, or with cheese, meat, gravy, or any other topping you like."
3495,Make Hardees Biscuits,15,none,16,Ladle the gravy over fresh biscuits and serve.,"Place one or two warm biscuits on a serving plate. Spoon or ladle about a ¼ cup (59 ml) of hot gravy over each biscuit and enjoy!Avoid pouring the gravy on the biscuits until you're ready to serve them, as the gravy can make the biscuits soggy."
3499,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,0,A,A1,Cut straight down the marrow long length way.,"Hold the marrow very firmly as you do so. Take a tablespoon and carefully take out the marrow watery seeds. They are a bit like cucumber seeds, but be careful not to dig into the marrow vegetable flesh too deeply with the metal spoon, as you need the marrow vegetable flesh to eat."
3500,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,1,A,A2,Bake the marrow.,"Once all of the marrow seeds are removed, place the 2 marrow halves on a baking tray and bake 200 °C (392 °F) for 35 mins in a preheated oven. Let the baby marrow cook in its own juices as the marrow is roasting.  You can eat the skin of the marrow as long as its a baby marrow. Baby marrow's skin tastes sweet. Older marrows skin is bitter. It is best for older marrow skin too be peeled and removed."
3501,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,2,A,A3,Prepare the filling.,You can make a tasty filling by placing creamy mashed potato on top of filling with 1/4 of grated cheese and 1/4 of fine bread crumbs for extra crunch.  Always taste a little during cooking for seasoning.
3502,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,3,A,A4,Add the filling.,"After about 35 mins of the marrow baking, take it out of the oven and fill the 2 marrow halves with the filling of your choosing."
3503,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,4,A,A5,Serve.,"Serve with mixed salad and sliced and buttered garlic bread, on a bed of mixed vegetable or spiced cooked rice."
3504,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,5,B,B1,Brown all meats until any blood red colour is gone.,Do this on a medium heat.
3505,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,6,B,B2,Maintain an equal amount of vegetable ratio to meat ratio.,Always ensure all red colour is gone from the red meat when the meat is properly browned. Meat should be very tender and evenly cooked.
3506,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,7,B,B3,Start the preparation.,Add 1 red peeled sliced and diced a red large onion and 1 peeled sliced and diced a large white onion.
3507,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,8,B,B4,Add spices.,"Add a pinch of salt, a pinch of dried mixed herbs to meat stock or vegetable stock cube. #*Roast vegetables of your choice for 30 mins on 180 degrees C."
3508,Make Stuffed Baked Marrow,9,B,B5,Combine all the ingredients.,Add the filling of cooked meat and mix through the roasted vegetables. Then place the filling in the marrow and bake at oven settings already mentioned.
3509,Make Barbacoa,0,A,A1,"Puree the sauce ingredients.Combine the chopped onions, olive oil, garlic, cumin, oregano, chiles, cider vinegar, and salt in a blender or food processor.",Blend the ingredients together at medium to high speed until a thick puree forms.   Do not drain the adobo sauce from the chipotle chiles before adding them. You should pour the sauce into the blender along with the chiles.;
3510,Make Barbacoa,1,A,A2,"Layer the sauce, beef, and broth in the slow cooker.Spread the sauce into the bottom of your slow cooker.","Place the beef on top of it, and pour the beef broth over the meat. Place the bay leaf on top.   Coat the beef in the sauce by turning it a few times, dipping all sides in the sauce at least once in the process. Use a 5-qt to 7-qt (5-L to 7-L) slow cooker for best results. Cut the beef into several chunks, if necessary, to fit it into the slow cooker."
3511,Make Barbacoa,2,A,A3,Cover and cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.,"If you want it done sooner, set the slow cooker to high and cook the beef for 6 hours.Resist the temptation to open the lid and peek at your meal as it cooks. Doing so releases the trapped steam, and that steam is partially responsible for cooking the meat. As a result, the overall cooking time can increase 15 to 30 minutes every time you open the slow cooker."
3512,Make Barbacoa,3,A,A4,Shred the beef.,"Remove the beef from the slow cooker and place it on a cutting board or rimmed baking sheet. Use two forks to shred the beef into pieces, working from the outside in.   While shredding the beef, you should also discard any fat. A rimmed baking sheet or cutting board works best since some of the juices inside the beef can run as you work with it. Without a rimmed surface, these juices can create a big mess."
3513,Make Barbacoa,4,A,A5,Mix the shredded beef with the barbacoa sauce.,"Transfer the shredded beef to a large bowl. Ladle a little of the cooking liquid into the bowl, mixing after each addition. Add enough sauce to keep the beef thoroughly moist, but do not add so much that the beef drown in it or becomes soupy.   If you have some cooking liquid left behind after you coat the beef, you can fill a spare ice cube tray with it and freeze the liquid for later use. These cubes of barbacoa sauce can be used to flavor stocks, soups, gravies, and other dishes later on."
3514,Make Barbacoa,5,A,A6,Keep it warm in the slow cooker.,"If you are not ready to serve the barbacoa yet, return it to the slow cooker and switch the appliance to its ""warm"" setting.   You can keep it warm using this method for another 2 to 4 hours. After that point, you should consider transferring any uneaten beef to airtight containers and storing it in the refrigerator. Reheat it in the microwave after refrigerator storage."
3515,Make Barbacoa,6,A,A7,Serve.,"The beef barbacoa is ready to eat. Serve it to your family or guests while still warm, and offer it with an accompaniment of tortillas, onion, cilantro, and salsa."
3520,Make Barbacoa,11,B,B5,Combine with the other marinade ingredients.,"Place the cumin powder, clove powder, ancho chile powder, onion, garlic, oregano, thyme, vinegar, and lime juice in a blender. Remove the chiles from the water and add them as well, along with 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of the chile-infused water. Cover and blend at a medium to high speed until a smooth paste forms.   A food processor could be used instead of a blender, but either way, you need to produce a smooth paste when done. Stop the blender occasionally and scrape the sides down with a spatula before continuing to blend."
3521,Make Barbacoa,12,B,B6,Marinate the beef.,"Place the beef into a large mixing bowl and cover it with the marinade paste. Cover the bowl securely using plastic wrap, then put it in the refrigerator 6 hours to overnight for marinating purposes.   For best results, turn the beef several times before you sealing off the bowl. Coat all sides of the beef in the sauce as you turn the roast."
3522,Make Barbacoa,13,B,B7,Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (165 degrees Celsius).,Prepare a large roasting pan by lightly spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.   Wait until the oven has completely finished preheating before moving on to the next step.
3523,Make Barbacoa,14,B,B8,Roast the barbacoa beef for 6 hours.,"Transfer the beef roast to the roasting pan. Pour the marinade over it, and place the bay leaf on top. Cover the whole thing with an oven-safe lid or aluminum foil and cook until the meat becomes very tender."
3524,Make Barbacoa,15,B,B9,Let stand before shredding.,"Remove the finished beef barbacoa out of the oven. Allow it to rest on the counter for roughly 45 to 60 minutes. When done, shred the beef with two forks.   Keep the cover on the roasting pan while the beef rests. This resting period allows the beef to finish cooking and forces the juices to distribute themselves more easily. It also gives the beef a little time to cool to a more comfortable, easier to eat temperature. Discard the bay leaf before shredding the beef."
3525,Make Barbacoa,16,B,B10,Serve.,"The beef barbacoa is ready to eat at this point. It is usually served warm with tortillas and various toppings, like chopped onions or cilantro."
3526,Make Barbacoa,17,C,C1,Clean the beef tongue.,"Rinse the beef tongue under cool running water and pat dry with clean paper towels.   When buying beef tongue, it is especially important that you purchase it from a reliable source. You may need to buy it in frozen form, rather than buying it fresh, since it is not a common cut of meat in most geographic areas."
3527,Make Barbacoa,18,C,C2,Place all the ingredients in a slow cooker.,"Put the beef tongue in the bottom of the slow cooker. Surround it with your cut onions and garlic cloves, then sprinkle it with salt. Pour the water over the entire thing.There is no need to turn the beef tongue. The flavors of the garlic, onion, and salt should sink into the meat as it cooks. Cover the slow cooker with its lid before continuing."
3528,Make Barbacoa,19,C,C3,Cook on low for 8 hours.,"The meat should be tender enough to shred when done.   If you do not have a full 8 hours, you could switch the slow cooker to high and cook the beef tongue for 4 to 5 hours, instead. Do not remove the lid during the initial cook time. Doing so can release too much steam, and since the steam is partially responsible for cooking the meat, letting it escape can increase the overall cook time by another 15 to 30 minutes. If the meat does not feel tender after 8 hours, you may need to cook it for another 1 to 2 hours."
3529,Make Barbacoa,20,C,C4,Remove the skin of the tongue.,"Place the cooked beef tongue in a large dish or rimmed baking sheet. Make a shallow cut in the skin at the open end of the beef tongue, then peel the rest of the skin off using your fingers.   You should also trim away any fatty tissue at the bottom end of the tongue using the knife. The majority of the cut will be edible meat, even after you cut away the skin and fat."

Wait until the gel can be cleanly cut before continuing."
3603,Make Cheese Curds,11,none,12,Check for a clean break.,"After the curd has rested, slice into the top of it with a knife to verify that it's ready to work with.  After cutting the slit, insert the wide, flat side of the knife into the curd and lift the curd where the slit ends. The slit should continue forward when you do this, creating an opening with a clean edge. If the curd isn't ready, allow it to continue cooking for a longer period of time."
3604,Make Cheese Curds,12,none,13,Cut the curd.,"Use a sharp knife to slice the curd into 3/8 to 1/2 inch (0.75 to 1.25 cm) cubes. Keep the size of the cubes as even as possible.  Slice into the curd, separating it into parallel vertical columns. Turn the knife, then cut through the curd in perpendicular columns, spacing them apart at even intervals."
3605,Make Cheese Curds,13,none,14,Allow the curds to set.,"Cover the pot and allow the curds to sit, undisturbed, for 3 to 5 minutes.Note that the curds should still be sitting at an approximate temperature of 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) during this stage."
3606,Make Cheese Curds,14,none,15,Gradually increase the cooking temperature.,"Gently stir the curds using an up-and-down motion while raising the cooking temperature. It should eventually reach a range between 100 and 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38 and 39 degrees Celsius).  This increase must happen gradually, so do not increase the stove heat above medium. Ideally, the increase will take approximately 30 minutes. If the curds begin to heat up too quick, you should remove the pot from the heat for several minutes to stop the temperature from climbing too fast."
3607,Make Cheese Curds,15,none,16,Cook for another 30 minutes.,"Cook the cheese curds at this temperature for another 30 to 60 minutes, or until the curds develop an even and springy texture.  Stir the curds every 5 minutes or so while they rest. You can continue cooking the curds for several minutes after they reach this consistency if you'd prefer a drier texture. Checking the pH isn't necessary, but if you choose to do so, the pH should be between 6.2 and 6.10."
3608,Make Cheese Curds,16,none,17,Drain the curds.,"Scoop out the curds using a slotted ladle and place them into a colander. Set the colander over the pot and allow the whey to drain.  To make gathering the curds easier, use your hands or the back of the ladle to press the curds into the bottom of the pot. After they form a solid mass, scoop out the mass and place it in the colander. The colander should rest above the whey and not inside of it. Place a thermometer into the curd, then cover the pot and allow it to rest for 10 to 15 minutes at 98 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius). When ready, the curds should mat and clump together into a solid mass."
3609,Make Cheese Curds,17,none,18,Cut the curds and let them rest.,"Remove the curds from the colander and cut the slab in half. Stack the two halves together, cover, and let them sit for 10 to 15 minutes.  You may wish to return the cut, stacked slabs to the colander to keep them warm.

3610,Make Cheese Curds,18,none,19,Flip and restack periodically for 2 hours.,"Flip the stacked curd slabs over every 10 to 15 minutes over a 2-hour period of time.  Check the texture of the curd after the first 90 minutes. When the curd is ready, it should tear apart like cooked chicken breast."
3611,Make Cheese Curds,19,none,20,Slice the curd.,"Place the curd onto a cutting board and cut it into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces.  Note that the slabs should be flattened to about 1 inch (2.5 cm) by this stage. Cut the curds into 1-inch (2.5-cm) strips, then cut the strips crosswise into 2-inch (5-cm) long pieces."
3612,Make Cheese Curds,20,none,21,Toss the curds with salt.,"Sprinkle the curds with the salt, then toss gently with your hands or a spoon until all of the salt is dissolved.Cover the salted curds and allow them to sit for 5 to 10 minutes. During this time, the curds should absorb the salt. More whey may drain away during this step, too. It might be a good idea to let the salted curds sit in your colander for that reason."

3650,Make Grape Jelly,0,none,1,"Choose your grapes, aiming for fresh, sweet, and flavorful berries.","The better the grapes, the better the jelly. It doesn't matter if they are seeded or seedless, green, white or red. That said, seeded grapes usually have a stronger flavor, and the majority of jellies are made with red or Concord grapes.You can also use 5 cups of grape juice in a pinch."
3651,Make Grape Jelly,1,none,2,Pick the grapes off the bunch and wash them off.,"You should have roughly five lbs of grapes to work with.   If you plan on canning all the jelly yourself, start preparing the cans now."

3654,Make Grape Jelly,4,none,5,Place the grapes into a jelly bag so that the juice drains out into a jar or pot below.Don't add water.,"Put about 2 cups at a time into the bag and let the juice drain. The jelly bag will collect the pulp, skin, and any seeds while the juice that you will use for the jelly drains out. You should have about 5 cups of juice at the end of this process.         Squeeze the juice through the bag with clean hands or by pressing it gently with a spoon. Empty and discard the pulp periodically if the juice is draining too slowly. Rinse the bag if needed. If you don't have a jelly bag, try forcing it through a mesh strainer lined with cheese cloth."

Get the foam off with a slotted spoon and move on.          For a little different flavor, consider adding 2-3 tablespoons of lemon juice here, giving your final jelly a bit of tangy-ness."
3658,Make Grape Jelly,8,none,9,Pour the hot liquid immediately into the hot canning jars.,"This is why preparing the jars ahead of time is so essential. By letting the mixture cool out in the open, you open the possibility that the jelly will crystallize and turn to a chunky, unappetizing mixture.         Leave roughly 1/4 of an inch between the top of the jar and your fill line."
3659,Make Grape Jelly,9,none,10,"Start boiling a large pot of water, enough to completely cover your cans.","Canning requires you to heat the jars (after the are filled with jelly) to sterilize them and preserve the fruit. You should have your hot water bath boiling at the same time as you jelly.The following method will help you if you do not have dedicated canning equipment. However, getting a canning set is almost always easier than using a homemade water bath.;"
3660,Make Grape Jelly,10,none,11,Sterilize your jars and lids before you begin cooking.,"This allows you to work efficiently, as opposed to rushing around as the jelly finishes. If you don't have a dishwasher with a sterilize setting, wash them with soap and water. Then boil the jars for 10 minutes, leaving them in the water until you're ready to use them. The lids should be kept in hot (but not boiling) water for 5-10 minutes.   The jars need to be hot when you pour in the jelly, otherwise they may crack."
3661,Make Grape Jelly,11,none,12,Fill the jars with jelly and put the clean lids and rings on.,"Canning jars have a lid and a ring. The lid needs to have an unbroken rubber seal along the outside edge, and these can only be used once for canning. The rims screw on top of the lid to close the jar completely."
3662,Make Grape Jelly,12,none,13,Gently place the closed jars in the boiling water for 5- 10 minutes.,"If you live above 1,000 feet above sea level, let them cook for the full ten minutes. Try to keep at least two inches of water above the top of the cans to speed up the process. Also, make sure that you have a tool capable of safely remove the hot cans from the boiling water before you begin.          If you live above 6,000ft above sea level, you should let the jars boil for closer to 15 minutes."
3663,Make Grape Jelly,13,none,14,"Let the jars cool overnight, and serve when done.","Place the jars in a cool place (not the refrigerator -- that's too cold) and let them cool back to room temperature. After 1-2 hours, when they don't burn you when touched, loosen the rims on the jars a half turn or so to prevent it from rusting or sticking onto the jar."
3664,Make Grape Jelly,14,none,15,Check that they jelly was properly preserved by pushing the top down.,"It shouldn't easily pop up and down, and shouldn't make a noise when pushed. If it does then you don't have the jar completely sealed, and the preserves will quickly spoil if you're not careful. Properly preserved jelly should last up to 12 months."
3666,Make Easter Treats,1,A,A2,"Cream the butter, salt, syrup, and vanilla.","To make the egg filling for the cream egg, add the four ingredients to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Cream the ingredients on medium low speed until combined.You can also add 3 drops orange blossom water to the mixture to give the eggs a hint of citrus. If you don’t have a stand mixer, combine the ingredients in a large mixing bowl and beat them with a hand mixer or whisk."
3667,Make Easter Treats,2,A,A3,Add the sugar.,"Reduce the speed to low and add the sugar 1 cup (125 g) at a time. Once all the sugar has been added, continue beating the mixture until the sugar has been fully incorporated.Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula to make sure all the ingredients get mixed."
3672,Make Easter Treats,7,A,A8,Combine the egg fillings.,"Remove the yolks from the freezer. Take one ball of egg white filling and place a yolk ball into the indent. Now use your hands to shape the egg white around the yolk so that the yellow is completely covered by white filling.Roll the combined filling into a ball, then gently shape it into an oval to create an egg shape. Continue combining the yolks and whites in this way until you have made all the egg fillings. Return the eggs to the baking sheet, cover them with plastic or parchment, and return them to the freezer."
3673,Make Easter Treats,8,A,A9,Melt the chocolate.,"Place the chocolate into a medium glass bowl. Fill a small saucepan with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place the glass bowl on top of the saucepan, and heat it over medium heat.  Whisk the chocolate regularly as it melts. When all the chocolate has melted, give the whole thing a vigorous whisking until the chocolate becomes glossy. Turn the heat to low so it’s warm enough to keep the chocolate liquid."
3674,Make Easter Treats,9,A,A10,Cover the eggs in chocolate.,"Remove one ball of egg filling from the freezer. Pierce the bottom with a toothpick so you can dip the entire egg in chocolate. Dip the filling in the melted chocolate. Remove the egg from the chocolate, and hold it over the bowl to allow the excess to drip off.Stick the other end of the toothpick into your potato or Styrofoam to secure the egg. Place the egg and the potato into the fridge for 10 minutes. This will give the chocolate time to set. Repeat until you’ve covered all the egg filling balls in chocolate."
3675,Make Easter Treats,10,A,A11,Fill in the holes and chill before serving.,"When the chocolate has set on the eggs, remove them from the fridge and pull them out of the potato. Carefully remove the toothpicks.  Use a small spoon to drizzle a bit of melted chocolate into the hole where the toothpick was. Place the eggs on the baking sheet and return them to the fridge. Let them chill for about two hours before serving."
3677,Make Easter Treats,12,B,B2,Make the cake ball dough.,"Place two-inch (5-cm) cubes of cake into the food processor and pulse until the cake is broken up into fine crumbs. Transfer the crumbs to a mixing bowl. Add a dollop of frosting and stir to completely combine the cake and frosting. Stir in another dollop of frosting as necessary, until the dough becomes the consistency of clay.If you don’t have a food processor, place the chunks of cake into a mixing bowl and mash them with a fork or break them up with your hands."
3679,Make Easter Treats,14,B,B4,Form the cake balls.,"When the dough has had time to chill, remove it from the fridge or freezer. Use your cookie dough scoop to portion out a scoop of dough. Roll the dough around between your hands to work it into an egg shape. Transfer the cake egg to the baking sheet.  Repeat with the remaining dough until you have formed all the cake into cake eggs. Set the eggs aside for about 30 minutes and allow them to warm to room temperature."
3680,Make Easter Treats,15,B,B5,Melt the candy melts.,"Transfer each color of candy melt to a separate glass bowl. Fill three saucepans with an inch (2.5 cm) of water and place the glass bowls on top. Heat each saucepan over medium heat, stirring regularly, until the melts have melted. Turn the heat on all the saucepans to low to keep the melts liquid.  Alternatively, you can also melt the candy melts in the microwave. Heat the candy melts in the microwave in 30-second bursts, stirring in between, until the candy melts have completely melted. The microwave method is faster, but the candy melts will start to harden faster, and you'll have to work quickly."
3682,Make Easter Treats,17,B,B7,Decorate the eggs with blue candy melt.,"Take each cake pop egg and dip the entire ball of cake into the blue candy melt. Pull the cake pop out at a 45-degree angle, twist it 90-degrees, and tap the stick against the side of the bowl to remove excess.  Set the cake pops back into their places in the Styrofoam or cake pop stand and transfer them to the fridge for five minutes to set. If you want to mix up the order of the egg coloring, don’t dip all the cake eggs into the blue. Dip one-third into the blue, one-third into the pink, and one third into the yellow."
3683,Make Easter Treats,18,B,B8,Add the pink.,"When the blue candy melt has set, remove the cake pops from the fridge. Now dip the top two-thirds of each cake pop into the pink candy melt. Pull the cake pop out at an angle, twist it, and tap it to remove excess.  When you’ve dipped all the pops into the pink, transfer them to the fridge again to set for another five minutes. If you divided the base color of your cake pops, make sure you dip each set of cake pops into a different color this time."
3684,Make Easter Treats,19,B,B9,Add the yellow.,"Finally, dip the top third of each cake pop into the yellow. When you’ve removed the excess, return the cake pops to the fridge and let them set for another five minutes before serving.  For divided cake pop colors, dip each cake pop into the color you haven't yet decorated it with."
3686,Make Easter Treats,21,C,C2,Dye Easter eggs.,"Easter eggs may not be edible, but they are a traditional way that many families celebrate Easter. Dyed eggs are colorful, pretty, and fun to make, and they're a great craft for kids of all ages!"

3691,Make Turkey Sausage,1,none,2,Add 2 lbs (0.9 kg) ground turkey to the large mixing bowl.,This is a typical amount for most turkey sausage recipes.
3692,Make Turkey Sausage,2,none,3,Combine all the seasonings in the small mixing bowl.,"This will include: 2 tbsp. (30 mL) chili powder, 1 clove of garlic (minced, either with garlic mincer or by hand), 2 tsp. (10 mL) cayenne pepper, 2 tsp. (10 mL) onion powder, 1 tsp. (5 mL) crushed red pepper, 1 tsp. (5 mL) dried oregano, 1 tsp. (5 mL) paprika, 1/2 tsp. (2.5 mL) sea salt, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) marjoram, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) thyme, 1/4 tsp. (1.25 mL) black pepper, and 1/8 tsp. (.625 mL) fennel seeds. To ensure an accurate and evenly combined seasoning mix, use a wire whisk until the seasoning colors look even throughout the bowl. The garlic clove will stick because of the moisture, so be sure to mix thoroughly.   An easy way to mince garlic without a garlic mincer is to place the clove under a butcher knife and slam a closed fist (side of pinky finger down) onto the knife. Be very cautious when using this method that the butcher knife does not slip from your grip or that you slam your hand onto a sharp edge. Season to your desired taste. If you prefer your turkey sausage not as spicy, try less cayenne, paprika, and crushed red peppers. Also, experiment with other flavors such as minced onion, cumin, nutmeg, ginger, basil, and sage to create your perfect seasoning combination."
3694,Make Turkey Sausage,4,none,5,Knead the seasonings into the turkey.,"Be sure to meticulously combine the seasonings within the ground turkey. Add the egg to create a goopy texture. The egg will add volume when you are cooking the meat.   Your hands will be covered with this mixture, so don't be shy about digging in. Kneading the ingredients completely throughout the turkey will ensure the best taste all around and avoid someone getting suckered into a big bite of intense seasoning."
3695,Make Turkey Sausage,5,none,6,Clump turkey and seasoning mixture into a ball and wrap tightly in cellophane or in a tightly sealed container.,Refrigerate approximately 24 hours.
3696,Make Turkey Sausage,6,none,7,Separate the ground turkey meat into several 1 inch (2.54 cm) balls.,Flatten each to create turkey sausage patties.
3697,Make Turkey Sausage,7,none,8,Pre-heat your frying pan.,"Add plenty of butter and allow it to melt before placing the meat on the pan. This will prevent the patties from sticking to the pan. Make sure the turkey sausage patties are fully cooked before serving (i.e. there is no longer pink meat on the inner, and especially outer, part of the patty). The minimum temperature in the middle of the patty should be at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius)."
3699,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,0,none,1,Preheat the oven.,"To ensure that the oven is hot enough when you’re ready to bake the cookies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the oven to 375 degrees (190 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Keep an eye on your oven so you know when it’s fully preheated. Most ovens will usually beep or flash a light to alert you.;"
3700,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,1,none,2,Prepare the cookie sheets.,"For the cookies, you’ll need 1 to 2 large cookie sheets. Line the sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent the cookies from sticking during baking. Set them aside until you’re ready to bake the cookies.You can get away with using only one cookie sheet, but you will likely need to bake multiple batches of cookies. If you don’t have parchment paper or silicone baking mats, you can grease your cookie sheets with nonstick cooking spray or butter."
3701,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,2,none,3,Cream the butter and sugars together.,"Use a handheld or stand mixer to combine 1 ¼ cups (284 g) of softened, unsalted butter, 1 cup (200 g) of packed dark brown sugar, and 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar in a large bowl. Blend the ingredients on medium speed until the mixture is light and fluffy.If you don’t have a handheld or stand mixer, you can mix the butter and sugars together by hand. It will take a little more time and effort, though, so you may want to allow the butter to soften longer to make the process easier."
3702,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,3,none,4,"Mix in the egg, vanilla, and molasses.","When the butter and sugars are creamed together, add 1 large egg, 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of pure vanilla extract, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of dark molasses to the bowl. Continue mixing the ingredients on medium until they’re fully combined, and then set the mixture aside for a moment.As you add the egg, vanilla, and molasses, scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary to ensure that the ingredients are all well mixed."
3703,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,4,none,5,Combine the dry ingredients.,"In a medium bowl, mix 1 ½ cups (180 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of baking soda, ½ teaspoon (3 g ) of salt, and ¾ teaspoon (2 g) of ground cinnamon together with a wooden spoon. When the ingredients are fully blended, add 3 cups (249 g) of uncooked, quick-cooking oats and stir until they’re fully incorporated.You can also mix in ¼ teaspoon (.5 g) of ground cloves with the cinnamon if you want to add some extra spice to the cookies. Make sure that you use quick-cooking oats for the cookies, not whole-rolled oats."
3704,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,5,none,6,Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients.,"When you’ve completely mixed the dry ingredients, begin to add them little by little to the wet ingredients on a low speed. The cookie batter will be extremely thick, so you will probably need to mix it by hand several times after using the electric mixer to ensure that the ingredients are fully combined."
3705,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,6,none,7,Place the dough on the cookie sheet with a scoop.,"When the cookie batter is completely mixed, use a large cookie scoop to drop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets. Each ball of dough should measure approximately 2 tablespoons (30 g).The cookies spread while baking, so make sure to place them at least 2-inches (5-cm) apart on the cookie sheet."
3706,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,7,none,8,Bake the cookies until they are lightly golden.,"Place the cookie sheet(s) in the preheated oven, and allow the cookies to bake until the edges become lightly golden. In most cases, that will take approximately 10 minutes."
3708,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,9,none,10,Beat the butter for several minutes.,"Add ¾ cup (170 g) softened unsalted butter to a large bowl, and use a handheld or stand mixer to beat the butter on medium-high for approximately 5 minutes. You want the butter to lighten in color and become fluffy so the cream will be light and smooth."
3709,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,10,none,11,Add the powdered sugar to the butter.,"Once the butter is light and fluffy, turn your mixer speed to low and gradually add 2 ½ cups (313 g) of confectioners’ sugar. Mix the ingredients until the sugar is fully incorporated.Confectioners’ sugar is also known as powdered sugar or icing sugar."
3710,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,11,none,12,Mix in the vanilla extract and cream.,"When the confectioners’ sugar is completely blended with the butter, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of pure vanilla extract and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of heavy cream with the mixer still set at a low speed. Blend the mixture until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can substitute half-and-half or whole milk for the heavy cream, but the cream filling will probably not be as creamy."
3711,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,12,none,13,Beat the mixture for several more minutes.,"When the ingredients are all fully incorporated, turn the mixer’s speed back up to medium-high. Beat the cream filling for 3 to 5 more minutes, or until it has a light, fluffy consistency.If the cream filling is too stiff or thick, you can add in more heavy cream. Mix it in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) at a time until you reach the proper consistency."
3712,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,13,none,14,Spread some of the filling over half of the cookies.,"When the filling is ready, arrange half of the cookies so they’re upside down. Use a knife or spoon to spread 1 to 1 ½ tablespoons of the cream filling across the cookies.The amount of filling that you should add depends on the size of the cookie. You want to spread the filling nearly all the way to the edges, so a larger cookie requires more cream."
3713,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,14,none,15,Place the remaining cookies on top to create sandwiches.,"After you’ve spread the cream filling over the cookies, use the other half of the cookies to create the pies. Press them down over the filling rightside up to create sandwiches.It’s okay if some of the filling is squeezed out the edges when you press the cookies together."
3714,Make Oatmeal Cream Pies,15,none,16,Store the cream pies in an airtight container.,"If you’re not eating the oatmeal cream pies right away, place them in an airtight container. You can leave them out at room temperature for up to two days, or place them in refrigerator for up to 5 days.If you’re storing the cream pies in the refrigerator, be sure to leave them out at room temperature for an hour or so before eating."

3735,Grill Bacon,0,A,A1,Light the grill.,"As with any sort of charcoal grilling, before you get started grilling your bacon, you'll need to get your charcoal to just the right heat for grilling. Before lighting them, however, make sure to offset the coals by piling them in one side of the grill, leaving the other coal-free. This will create a hot side of the grill and a cool side when the coals are lit. When you're ready, light the grill.   Note that if you aren't using match-light charcoal, this may require lighter fluid. After lighting, leave the lid off and wait for the coals to burn to perfection. Coals are typically ready for grilling after they develop a grey, ashy exterior and emit a warm orange glow. This can take 20 minutes or longer.;"
3736,Grill Bacon,1,A,A2,Oil the grill grate.,"When you're ready to cook your bacon, quickly paint the grill with a small amount of neutral vegetable oil. There are several ways to do this, but the easiest way is usually either by using a grill brush or by grabbing a bunched-up paper towel in a pair of tongs, dipping it in the oil, and quickly rubbing it across the grate. Because bacon is naturally quite fatty, you don't need much oil to prevent it from sticking to the grill during cooking.   If you don't have oil, you can probably get away with either quickly rubbing one fatty piece of bacon across the grate or else just ignoring this step entirely. Note, however, that some sticking may occur in this case."
3737,Grill Bacon,2,A,A3,Place the bacon onto the cool side.,"Using a pair of tongs to protect your hands, place the strips of bacon on the cool side of the grill (the side with no coals underneath). As the bacon cooks, the fat will naturally render and drip down into the grill. If you cook the bacon over the coals, this can lead to massive flare-ups as the bacon fat ignites.To avoid the danger of burns, fire, or burnt bacon, cook using only indirect heat. The bacon fat will still drip down into the grill, but since there are no coals underneath, flare-ups will be minimal.   Try to lay most or all of your bacon strips across the bars of the grate, rather than parallel to the bars. This makes it less likely for the thin bacon to slip through the cracks of the grill into the ashy area underneath."
3738,Grill Bacon,3,A,A4,Turn the bacon during cooking.,"As the bacon cooks, it will naturally begin to shrink, darken, and toughen up. To ensure booth sides get thoroughly cooked, be sure to turn the bacon as it cooks, beginning about when these effects of cooking become visible on the bottom side of the bacon. Aim to turn the bacon at least every 5 minutes or so, replacing the lid of the grill between each turn.   Cooking times will vary widely depending on the temperature of the grill, the thickness of the bacon strips, and your preference for crispiness, so be sure to check the bacon often. The total cooking time should be no more than 20 minutes or so. If you prefer ""softer"" bacon, yours may be ready in as little as 7-10 minutes. For other cuts of meat, there is a long-raging debate in the culinary community about whether excessive turning ruins the meat. This is a non-issue for bacon, which most agree benefits from a fair amount of turning."
3739,Grill Bacon,4,A,A5,Remove the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate.,"When the bacon is done, it should have an appearance ranging from red to dark brown (depending on how crispy you like it) and a delicious aroma. Remove the bacon from the grill strip-by-strip and place it onto a plate lined with several layers of paper towels. Allow the paper towels to absorb some of the excess fat, then serve the bacon as desired!   As with turning during cooking, bacon proves the exception to other meats in terms of allowing it to rest before serving. While many other cuts of meat are noticeably moister and more flavorful after resting for 10-15 minutes following cooking, bacon is ready to eat as soon as it's cool enough not to burn your mouth!"
3740,Grill Bacon,5,B,B1,"Set the burners to ""low"".","Your goal when cooking bacon on a gas grill isn't to cook the bacon directly on the grill grate — if you do this, the fat, which renders and liquefies as the bacon cooks, can drip down onto the burners. This is even more of a problem here than it is for a charcoal grill because, in addition to causing flare-ups, dripping grease can get the burners or bottom of a gas grill dirty. To avoid this, we'll use a modified indirect cooking method that uses all of the burners (as opposed to the offset coal method above).   Begin by lighting most or all of the grill's burner's and closing the lid. Let the grill heat up for several minutes before beginning cooking."
3741,Grill Bacon,6,B,B2,Place the bacon in a roasting pan.,"While you're waiting for the grill to warm up, lay your bacon strips over the grate in a roasting pan. This pan should consist of a metal grate that fits into a lower ""grease catcher"" with no holes in it. This allows the bacon to safely cook from the heat of the grill without dripping grease onto the bottom of the grill or burners.   As an added bonus, roasting pans make for easy cleanup — just pour the grease out of the lower pan, wash the pan and the grate, and you're done!"
3742,Grill Bacon,7,B,B3,Cook the bacon with the lid closed.,"Add your roasting pan full of bacon to the grill and shut the lid. This keeps the heat from the burners inside the grill, cooking the bacon from both above and below in a fashion similar to baking it. To keep your cooking time low, keep the lid shut during cooking except for when you check on the bacon's progress.   Don't forget to turn doing the cooking process — though it's not as essential here because the heat is coming from all sides, rather than just from below, it's still necessary for even cooking. You'll want to turn at least as it cooks — more is fine, but may lengthen the cooking time by allowing the grill's heat to escape. Keep a close eye on your bacon as it cooks — if it's cooking too quickly, flip it immediately and reduce the heat."
3743,Grill Bacon,8,B,B4,Serve as normal.,"Once the bacon is cooked on both sides to your liking, use a pair of tongs to remove it from the grill to a paper towel-lined plate. At this point, you're more or less done! Shut off your grill and, once it's cool enough to handle, carefully remove your roasting pan."
3744,Grill Bacon,9,C,C1,Use a sheet of aluminum foil for safety and ease of cleanup.,"No matter whether you're using a gas or charcoal grill, aluminum foil is your friend in a pinch. It's easy to improvise a grilling pan from a single large sheet of aluminum foil — simply fold the sheet in half over itself (to give it added thickness), then fold the edges up an inch or so so that they'll hold in grease from the bacon's fat. Lay the bacon strips directly into this ""pan"" and turn as normal during the cooking process. When the bacon is done, remove it from the pan and into a paper towel-lined plate. Carefully remove and dispose of the foil once the grill has cooled.   Note that using an aluminum foil ""dish"" makes it less necessary to offset your coal pile in a charcoal grill. Since the rendered fat isn't falling directly into the grill unless the aluminum tears, you have the option to cook directly over the coals. Note, though, that this can give faster cooking times."
3746,Grill Bacon,11,C,C3,Season the bacon during cooking.,"Bacon is unique among meats in that it tastes perfectly delicious without any seasoning at all (beyond the ingredients used to cure it, of course). However, this doesn't mean you can't spice it up! By seasoning your bacon before cooking with your favorite ingredients or spices, you can give it delicious new flavor and increase its versatility in a huge variety of dishes. Here are just a few examples of seasonings that work well with bacon — simply sprinkle these directly on the bacon right before cooking:   RosemaryRed pepper flakes Minced garlic Cajun seasoning Black pepper Steak seasoning Brown sugar"
3747,Grill Bacon,12,C,C4,Consider other barbecue recipes that use bacon.,"Grilling bacon on its own is fine and dandy, but why stop there? Below are just a few basic barbecue dishes that use bacon or can easily be made to accommodate it — feel free to add bacon to any other dishes you know as well:Bacon-wrapped asparagus stalks Bacon-wrapped chicken Bacon cheeseburgers Barbecue beans Chili Roasts (pork, beef, venison, turkey, etc.)"

3759,Make Atole,2,none,3,Pour the milk into the large saucepan or pot.,Place on the heat and cook until it simmers. Stir often to prevent the mixture from burning.
3760,Make Atole,3,none,4,Stir the cornstarch and water mix into the milk once it has reached simmering point.,"Stir around, then remove from the heat."
3761,Make Atole,4,none,5,"At this point, the atole should have thickened.",Look for a consistency around that of a milkshake.
3762,Make Atole,5,none,6,Sprinkle in the sugar.,Stir it around to dissolve.
3763,Make Atole,6,none,7,Sprinkle cinnamon into the atole.,Stir through the drink.
3764,Make Atole,7,none,8,Pour the atole into mugs ready for drinking.,You can pour it into bowls if preferred. Serve.
3765,Make Cabbage Soup,0,A,A1,Cook the meat.,"Place the water and the short ribs in a large stockpot. Put the pot on the stove over medium-high heat and bring it to a full boil. Reduce the heat to low, bringing the water to a simmer, and continue cooking for an hour, skimming the foam off the top every so often.         Be sure to use a very large pot, or the foam may overflow. Keep the pot uncovered as the meat cooks.;"
3766,Make Cabbage Soup,1,A,A2,Prepare the vegetables.,"While the beef cooks, prepare your vegetables by rinsing them clean and cutting them into the appropriate-size pieces.  Rough-chop the onion into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) pieces. Slice the cabbage into 1-inch (2.5-cm) portions. Discard the thick stem."
3768,Make Cabbage Soup,3,A,A4,Add the remaining ingredients.,"Add the cabbage, onion, ketchup, tomato, sugar, lemon juice, paprika, and salt to the stockpot. Mix well to combine, making sure the cabbage is fully submerged in soup."
3769,Make Cabbage Soup,4,A,A5,Simmer to blend the flavors.,"Simmer the soup for another hour on low heat. Taste the soup and add more salt and pepper as desired.          Once everything is tender and the broth tastes as desired, the soup is ready to serve. Ladle it into individual serving dishes."
3770,Make Cabbage Soup,5,B,B1,Saute the potatoes.,"Place the olive oil in a large stockpot and heat it up for a minute or two over medium-high heat. Add the chopped potatoes and the salt, and stir them to coat with olive oil. Cook the potatoes until they are soft, which should take about 10 minutes.         Don't overcook the potatoes, since they'll keep cooking with the rest of the soup ingredients. You can wait and add the salt later if you'd like, but adding it now will allow it to blend more evenly with the natural taste of the potato. Adding it later, however, will make it easier to adjust the final taste of the soup (simply add it when adjusting the seasonings toward the end of the recipe)."
3771,Make Cabbage Soup,6,B,B2,Add the garlic and onions.,"Place them in the pot with the potatoes and stir. Keep cooking the mixture until the onions turn translucent, which should only take three to five minutes.          Stir frequently to prevent the garlic and onions from burning. If either one burns, it could ruin the taste of the potatoes, even if you remove the burnt garlic or onion from the pan."
3772,Make Cabbage Soup,7,B,B3,Add the broth and beans.,"Pour the broth into the pot, then add the beans. Stir the mixture with a long-handled spoon. Bring the broth to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce it to low so that the broth is at a simmer."
3773,Make Cabbage Soup,8,B,B4,Add the cabbage and spices.,"Stir well after adding them to the soup. Cook the soup for 30 minutes, or until the cabbage is tender. Taste and add more salt and pepper as desires.          The soup is ready once everything is tender and the taste is to your liking. Serve the soup with a dollop of sour cream or some grated cheese."
3774,Make Cabbage Soup,9,C,C1,Sauté the vegetables.,"Place the olive oil in a large stockpot and heat it up over medium-high for a minute or two. Place the celery, onions, carrots and bell pepper in the oil and sauté until they are tender, stirring every few minutes.          This should only take approximately five minutes, but exact timing may vary on a case-by-case basis."
3775,Make Cabbage Soup,10,C,C2,Add the garlic.,"Put the garlic in the pot with the vegetables and continue cooking the mixture until the garlic becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes.          Garlic can burn very quickly, so it's important to stir it constantly and keep a close eye on it as it browns."
3776,Make Cabbage Soup,11,C,C3,Add the stock and tomatoes.,"Place the stock and tomatoes in the pot and bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer (low to medium-low heat). Stir constantly so no vegetables stick to the bottom of the pot."
3777,Make Cabbage Soup,12,C,C4,Mix in the cabbage and spices.,"After adding the cabbage, keep cooking the soup until the cabbage is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the soup and add more seasonings if desired."
3778,Make Cabbage Soup,13,C,C5,Enjoy.,The soup should be finished and ready to enjoy once everything is tender and seasoned to taste.
3781,Smoke a Brisket Texas Style,2,none,3,Start the smoker about 1 hour before you are ready to start smoking the brisket using a wood of your choice.,Pre burn your wood to coals before adding them to the fire. Keep the temp of the smoker around 200-250 the entire time.
3782,Smoke a Brisket Texas Style,3,none,4,Place the brisket fat side up on the smoker for about 1 hour per pound.,It will look like a black lump of coal when its done. When it's finished let it sit for about 30 minutes before slicing. (You can wrap it in foil and towels then place it into an ice chest to keep it warm if you're not ready to serve it.)
3783,Smoke a Brisket Texas Style,4,none,5,Add a sauce of your choice and serve.,
3784,Smoke Salmon,0,none,1,Use only fresh fish.,"Clean and dress the fish as soon as it has been caught, then proceed to readying it for smoking. While preparing the smokehouse, etc., keep the fish on ice."
3786,Smoke Salmon,2,none,3,Make up a solution of the salt and water as per the ratio outlined above.,;
3787,Smoke Salmon,3,none,4,Add the fish to the brine.,Let soak for 1 hour.
3788,Smoke Salmon,4,none,5,Remove the fish and drain.,Rinse to remove accumulated salt. A stiff brush can help remove any lumps of salt that may have formed.
3789,Smoke Salmon,5,none,6,Dry the fish at the appropriate temperature.,"It should be cool and dry air at 50 to 56ºF/10 to 18.3ºC. If you cannot provide this, some other options are:   Drying outdoors: Place in the shade or the sun will ruin the fish. Using a smokehouse: Place inside at low heat (80 to 90ºF/26.7 to 32.2ºC, without smoke and leaving the doors open."
3790,Smoke Salmon,6,none,7,Smoke the fish once the pellicle has formed.,
3791,Smoke Salmon,7,none,8,Hang in such a way as to allow plenty of air to circulate around the fish.,"A typical method is to hang the fish from a ""S"" hook or over dowels, pierced through the gill. Alternatively, lay fish or fillets down on oiled/greased wire mesh trays or racks."
3792,Smoke Salmon,8,none,9,"If cold smoking, smoke as follows (it is assumed you know how to cold smoke):24 hours will be required for short-term (up to a week) storage.","About 5 days is required for thicker pieces and for longer-term storage.Expose the fish to light smoke at the beginning (keep the vent open for the first third of the smoking period), then increase the amount of smoke but keep the temperature below 90ºF/32.2ºC."
3793,Smoke Salmon,9,none,10,"For hot smoking, smoke for about 6-8 hours (it is assumed you know how to hot smoke).","Smoke at 100ºF/37.7ºC for the first 2-4 hours, then gradually increase the oven temperature to 140ºF/60ºC until the salmon flesh becomes flaky."
3794,Smoke Salmon,10,none,11,Heat the fish internally to 160ºF/71.1ºC for a minimum of 30 minutes during the entire hot smoking cycle.,This will kill bacteria present in or on the fish.   The smokehouse will need to be set to 200 to 225ºF/93.3 to 107.2ºC for at least 30 minutes to achieve this. Use a standard meat thermometer to test the fish's internal temperature.
3795,Smoke Salmon,11,none,12,Smoke for at least another 30 minutes after it has reached this internal temperature.,"At all times after the 30 minute internal heating up, keep the fish above 140ºF/60ºC, even when continuing to smoke it."
3797,Smoke Salmon,13,none,14,Remove the smoked salmon from the smokehouse.,It must be attended to immediately to prevent bacterial growth.
3798,Smoke Salmon,14,none,15,"For short-term storage: Allow the fish to completely cool, then wrap in food-grade plastic wrap or wax paper (wrapping it while still warm can encourage mold growth).","To be doubly sure of no mold growth, wrap in cheesecloth before wrapping in plastic wrap. Store in the refrigerator. This must be consumed within 1 to 2 weeks of smoking."
3800,Smoke Salmon,16,none,17,Rig up a wok as a fast smoker.,"To make this contraption, simply line the wok with foil."
3803,Smoke Salmon,19,none,20,Put the lid on.,Fold more foil right over the lid to seal it to the wok.
3804,Smoke Salmon,20,none,21,Cook the wok on high.,"Cook for about 5 minutes, then lower the heat."
3805,Smoke Salmon,21,none,22,Cook for another 10 minutes on a lower heat.,Check halfway to see how the fish is going.
3806,Smoke Salmon,22,none,23,Serve immediately.,"Any uneaten portions must be refrigerated and eaten with a day or two. Do not leave the smoky fish sitting at room temperature for any extended period. It is not smoked, just smoky in flavor."
3807,Make Dim Sum,0,A,A1,Set the bamboo steamer over simmering water.,"Fill a saucepan with 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water and set it on your stove over medium to medium-high heat. Position your bamboo steamer over the pan.   There must be enough water to create steam, but the water level must not be high enough to touch the bottom of the steamer. Use a bamboo steamer for the most traditional experience and taste. If you do not have a bamboo steamer, however, an ordinary steamer basket will also work.;"
3808,Make Dim Sum,1,A,A2,Puree the shrimp.,"Place the peeled, de-veined shrimp in a food processor and blend them into a puree or thick paste.   If you do not have a food processor, you can puree the shrimp using a blender or cut the shrimp into 1/2-inch (1.25-cm) segments using a sharp knife. Note that the shrimp should still be uncooked."
3809,Make Dim Sum,2,A,A3,Combine the shrimp with the other filling ingredients.,"Transfer the shrimp to a large mixing bowl and add the water chestnuts, sesame oil, sake, mirin, soy sauce, salt, and white pepper. Mix thoroughly until evenly combined.   The water chestnuts should be minced into small pieces before you add them. Minced bamboo shoots can be used instead of the water chestnuts, or you could use a combination of the two if you'd prefer both flavors. Other substitutions you can make include dry sherry instead of sake, sugar instead of mirin, and black bean garlic sauce instead of soy sauce."
3810,Make Dim Sum,3,A,A4,Spread out the wrappers.,"Separate the wrappers and spread them out over a clean counter or table. You should need 16 wrappers for this recipe.   Ready-made dumpling wrappers work best for this recipe, but you can use wonton skins of you cannot find dumpling wrappers. Since wonton skins are square instead of circular, however, you'll need to round off the corners before filling them."
3811,Make Dim Sum,4,A,A5,Place a spoonful of filling into the center of each wrapper.,"Spoon a small dollop of shrimp filling into the center of each dumpling wrapper.   You should only use approximately 1 tsp (5 ml) of filling for each wrapper. If you use too much, the ends won't be able to seal correctly and the dumpling will open as it cooks."
3812,Make Dim Sum,5,A,A6,Fold and press the edges.,"Fold the wrappers over the filling to create half-circles. Firmly press the edges together to seal the wrappers.   If the ends won't stick together, wet your fingers with clean water and lighten dampen the edges before trying again. You should also crimp the edges using a fork or similar utensil to help hold the seal."
3813,Make Dim Sum,6,A,A7,Steam the dumplings for 4 to 7 minutes.,Place the dumplings into the steamer in a single layer. Cover the basket and steam for 4 to 7 minutes.   You should be able to see the shrimp filling through the thin wrapper. Wait for the shrimp to change in color from translucent gray to opaque pink and white.
3814,Make Dim Sum,7,A,A8,Serve hot.,Remove the finished dumplings from the steam and let them rest for 3 minutes. Serve while still hot.
3815,Make Dim Sum,8,A,A9,Dice the pork and shrimp.,"Dice both ingredients into fine pieces. Combine the pork with the soy sauce and ginger in a small bowl. Toss the shrimp with half the salt in another dry bowl.   Before dicing the shrimp, it should be peeled and de-veined. You should also rinse it in clean water and dry it on clean paper towels."
3816,Make Dim Sum,9,A,A10,Mix the sauce.,"Whisk together the cornstarch, sesame oil, rice wine, water, pepper, and remaining salt in a small bowl until thoroughly and evenly combined.   Rice wine will produce the most traditional flavor, but sherry can be used if rice wine is unavailable."
3817,Make Dim Sum,10,A,A11,Heat the canola oil.,Pour the canola oil into a small skillet and set the pan on your stove over medium heat.
3818,Make Dim Sum,11,A,A12,Cook the pork and shrimp.,Add the pork and shrimp to the hot oil and stir-fry until both ingredients are fully cooked.   Use your spatula to further break up the pork into crumbles as it cooks. Both the pork and shrimp must be completely cooked before you continue.
3819,Make Dim Sum,12,A,A13,Add the sauce and green onions.,"Pour the sauce into the pan and sprinkle in the diced green onions. Continue to cook the mixture for another few minutes, stirring frequently.   Wait until the sauce thickens before you continue. It may need to reach a simmer before adequate thickening occurs."
3821,Make Dim Sum,14,A,A15,Chop the taro root.,Peel the taro root and use a sharp knife to cut it into 1-inch to 2-inch (2.5-cm to 5-cm) square pieces.   Note that you should remove the tough outer layer of flesh along with the skin as you peel the taro. Also note that thinner pieces of taro will cook faster than thicker pieces.
3823,Make Dim Sum,16,A,A17,Combine the wheat starch and hot water.,"Place the wheat starch in a medium bowl and gradually pour the boiling water into it, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon to combine the two ingredients into a paste.   Stop adding water as soon as the mixture matches the appearance and texture of frosting. Loosely cover the bowl and set it aside. You really should use wheat starch for this dough if at all possible. Use tapioca flour in a pinch, but know that the final appearance and consistency will vary slightly if you do."
3825,Make Dim Sum,18,A,A19,"Combine the dough, taro, and remaining ingredients.","Place 1 cup (250 ml) of mashed taro into the wheat starch mixture. Add the salt and sugar, as well, and mix with your fingers until evenly blended. Add the lard or shortening after that.   Work the lard into the dough using your fingers. You'll need to knead the dough for several minutes, or until it takes on the consistency of mashed potatoes."
3827,Make Dim Sum,20,A,A21,Separate the dough into 12 pieces.,"Roll the dough into a 12-inch (30.5-cm) log and cut the log into 12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.   If the dough seems warm and soft after you finish rolling out the pieces, chill the dough balls for another 10 to 15 minutes before continuing."
3829,Make Dim Sum,22,A,A23,Fill the dumplings.,Place 1 tsp (5 ml) of filling in the center of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper around the filling and pinch the edges in place.   Each dumpling should be shaped like an egg or almond. Use excess dough to patch any holes that develop as you form the dumplings.
3830,Make Dim Sum,23,A,A24,Heat the frying oil.,"Pour 2 inches (5 cm) of canola oil or peanut oil into a heavy saucepan with deep sides. Heat over medium-high until the oil reaches a temperature between 360 and 370 degrees Fahrenheit (182 to 188 degrees Celsius).   Test the temperature using a cooking thermometer. The oil must be hot enough before you add the dumplings; otherwise, the dough will fall apart as it cooks."
3831,Make Dim Sum,24,A,A25,Fry the dumplings.,"Add the dumplings to the hot oil and fry until they turn golden-brown.   Avoid crowding the pan by only cooking two or three dumplings at a time. Once the dumplings begin to float, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking them. After 2 or 3 minutes, the dumplings should be done."
3832,Make Dim Sum,25,A,A26,Serve hot.,Remove the dumplings from the hot oil and let them drain on clean paper towels for several minutes. Serve them while they're still hot.
3844,Make Bumble Bees,4,none,5,Place each bumble bee on a tray lined with baking paper.,
3845,Make Bumble Bees,5,none,6,Place in the oven and bake for 15-20 minutes.,
3847,Make Waffle Fries,0,A,A1,Heat the oil.,"Pour 4 inches (10 cm) of cooking oil into the deep fryer. Switch on the heat and allow the oil to reach 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).If you don't have a deep fryer, you could pour the oil into a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the pot on the stove over medium-high heat. Use a frying thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil. It should remain at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for the duration of the cooking process. Adjust your temperature settings as needed to achieve this.;"
3848,Make Waffle Fries,1,A,A2,Clean the potatoes.,"Rinse the potatoes under cool, running water while scrubbing off the dirt with a vegetable brush.   Thorough cleaning is important if you intend to keep the skins on for your fries. On the other hand, if you prefer fries without skin, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. Since the dirty skins are gone, you won't need to scrub the potatoes with a brush."
3849,Make Waffle Fries,2,A,A3,Slice the potato using a ridged waffle blade.,"Insert the waffle blade attachment into the mandolin. Pass the end of the potato over the blade, making one ridged slice.   The waffle blade should have ridges on it. If your mandolin allows you to choose the thickness of the slices, choose a thickness of at least 1/4 inch (6 mm). If you don't have a mandolin, you could also use a ridged cheese knife. Make a straight cut down over the end of the potato and create slices roughly 1/4 inch (6 mm) thick, if not a little thicker."
3851,Make Waffle Fries,4,A,A5,Fry the potatoes in batches.,"Place several cut slices into the hot oil. Fry for several minutes, turning as needed, until the fries turn golden brown.   Watch the fries closely to prevent them from burning. You need to fry the potatoes in batches instead of frying them all at once. Adding too many to the hot oil can crowd out the pan and cause the temperature to drop. As a result, the fries won't cook correctly."
3852,Make Waffle Fries,5,A,A6,Drain the excess oil.,"Use a slotted spoon to remove the finished fries from the hot oil. Transfer them to a plate lined with clean paper towels.   While waiting for the oil to drain, you can start on your next batch of fries."
3853,Make Waffle Fries,6,A,A7,Add salt and enjoy.,Sprinkle salt over the fries while they're still hot and eat them immediately to enjoy the best taste.
3854,Make Waffle Fries,7,B,B1,"Preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (230 degrees Celsius).Meanwhile, prepare a 15-inch by 10-inch (38-cm by 25-cm) baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.","Alternatively, you could lightly coat the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray instead of using oil."
3855,Make Waffle Fries,8,B,B2,Clean the potatoes.,"Rinse the potatoes under running water while scrubbing the skins with a stiff vegetable brush.   If you wish to keep the skins, you need to scrub off the dirt in this manner. If you don't wish to keep the skins, peel the potatoes first and rinse them under running water when finished. You should not need to scrub them since the dirty skins are already gone."
3856,Make Waffle Fries,9,B,B3,Slice the potato using a ridged waffle blade.,"Secure the waffle blade attachment in the mandolin. Using firm, even pressure, pass the end of the potato over the blade, creating the first slice.   The waffle blade should have ridges on it. To prevent the fries from becoming too thin, use a thickness of 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm). If you don't have a mandolin, consider using a ridged cheese knife. Chop straight down over the end of the potato using this knife, making slices that are 1/4 to 1/2 inch (0.6 to 1.25 cm) thick."
3857,Make Waffle Fries,10,B,B4,Rotate and continue slicing.,"Turn the potato 90 degrees. The vertical grooves should now run horizontally. Make a second slice from this angle.   Rotating the potato in this manner should create the crisscross waffle pattern. If you don't rotate the potato, you'll get ridged fries instead of waffle fries. Continue slicing both potatoes in this manner, rotating 90 degrees in between each slice."
3858,Make Waffle Fries,11,B,B5,Bake the potato slices.,"Spread the potato slices onto your prepared baking sheet, arranging them in a single layer. Bake the fries in your preheated oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.   The exact amount of time may vary depending on how thick you cut the fries. You may need to check the progress every 5 minutes after the first 15 minutes to prevent the fries from burning. If you'd prefer evenly browned fries, consider turning the fries with a spatula after the first 15 minutes. Allow the other sides to brown for the duration of the cooking time."
3859,Make Waffle Fries,12,B,B6,Toss with salt and enjoy.,"Remove the hot fries from the oven and sprinkle them with salt according to your own tastes. While these fries shouldn't get soggy, they'll still taste best when eaten hot and fresh from the oven."
3861,Make Waffle Fries,14,C,C2,Peel and rinse the potatoes.,"Peel the skin off the potatoes. Rinse off any stray dirt and pat the potatoes dry with clean paper towels.   If you'd prefer to keep the skins, wash the potatoes under running water and thoroughly scrub off any dirt using a stiff vegetable brush."
3862,Make Waffle Fries,15,C,C3,Shred the potatoes.,"Using a box grater or mandolin, grate both potatoes into thick shreds.At this point, the raw potatoes should look similar to hash browns. Do not rinse the shredded potatoes since doing so will rinse away too much of the potatoes' natural starch. That starch is necessary since it will help bind the shreds together."
3864,Make Waffle Fries,17,C,C5,"Combine the potatoes, butter, salt, and pepper.","Place the shredded potatoes into a large bowl. Drizzle the melted butter on top and sprinkle the potatoes with salt and pepper.   Use your hands or a mixing spoon to toss the ingredients together, coating the potatoes evenly with the butter and seasonings."
3865,Make Waffle Fries,18,C,C6,Spread the potatoes over the hot iron.,"Spoon the seasoned potatoes over the bottom of the preheated waffle iron. Arrange the shreds into a thin, even layer.   Depending on the size of the waffle iron and the size of the potatoes, you may need to separate the shredded potatoes into two batches. Cook one batch, remove the finished fries, and cook the second batch in the same manner."
3866,Make Waffle Fries,19,C,C7,Close and cook.,"Close the waffle iron and allow the fries to cook until they reach a deep golden brown.   The amount of time may vary depending on your waffle maker. It's generally a good idea to check on the fries after 5 or 6 minutes, though. If the bottom of the fries are cooking faster than the tops, consider flipping them over before you finish cooking them."
3867,Make Waffle Fries,20,C,C8,Serve while still hot.,Use a fork to carefully lift the finished waffle fries out of the waffle iron. Enjoy the fries while they're still hot for the best flavor and texture.
3868,Make a Tostada,0,none,1,Preheat the oven to 350º F/ 117º C/ Gas Mark 4.;,
3869,Make a Tostada,1,none,2,Prepare the tortilla.,Place the fried corn tortilla on an oven safe plate.
3870,Make a Tostada,2,none,3,Place a layer of re-fried beans on top of the tortilla.,Make sure to cover the whole tortilla.
3871,Make a Tostada,3,none,4,Sprinkle the beans and tortilla with the Cheddar cheese.,"Place it in the oven for about 5 minutes, or until the cheese is completely melted. Once the cheese is completely melted, remove the plate from the oven."
3872,Make a Tostada,4,none,5,Prepare the salad.,"Transfer the tortilla to the bowl or plate on which you will serve the tostada. Add lettuce, peas, green beans, carrots, and beets so that they form a little mountain on top of the tortilla ."
3873,Make a Tostada,5,none,6,Pour on the salad dressing and then sprinkle the cheese all around the top.,
3874,Make a Tostada,6,none,7,Garnish the tostada with the avocado slices and the tomatoes.,Serve.
3875,Make Snow Cones,0,none,1,Crush ice to your blender.,"You can add a little bit of ice to make a personal snow cone, a moderate amount of ice to serve a few people, or you could fill the blender with ice to create many servings. Be sure to follow the directions that came with your blender for best results.          Depending on your blender, you might have many different settings to choose from when crushing your ice. In many cases, the puree feature will give you finely crushed ice, which is ideal for snow cones. You might like your snow cones with larger bits of ice. If so, you should blend your ice for a shorter period of time. Extra fine ice can be achieved by running the ice through the blender for longer. If you don't have a blender, you can put your ice in a heavy duty plastic bag and smash the ice with a rolling pin, hammer, or tenderizing mallet. You could also drop your ice repeatedly onto a hard surface to crush this ice, though this may take some time.You can also make your snow cone out of fresh, clean snow. You should exercise caution when doing this, though. Some snow may contain impurities that are unhealthy to consume.;"
3876,Make Snow Cones,1,none,2,Remove the ice from your blender.,"You can leave your ice in the blender and scoop it out for the snow cones, but you should be careful that no one accidentally cuts themselves on the blades at the bottom of the blender. To prevent this, you may want to pour or scoop your ice from the blender into a bowl.For especially large parties, you might have to prepare several blender's worth of ice and put it in a bowl for serving. You can keep your ice frozen until you're ready to serve it by keeping the blended ice in your freezer. You shouldn't leave your blended ice in the freezer for too long. If you do, it may refreeze leaving you with a bowl of solid ice."
3877,Make Snow Cones,2,none,3,Scoop the ice into a cup.,"Traditionally, at fairs and summer events, snow cones are served in paper cones. These are a cheap and disposable way of serving your snow cones, so you may want to use these yourself. You could also use a mug cup, a paper cup, or a plastic cup, depending on your preference.         You should fill your cup until it is full of crushed ice. You can use a large serving spoon, but you may want to use an ice cream scoop to give your snow cones a rounded shape."
3878,Make Snow Cones,3,none,4,Drizzle flavoring over your snow cone.,"There are many different ways you can flavor your snow cone. You can use juice, soda, or specially made syrups. In most cases, one to two tablespoons per two scoops of ice should be enough to flavor your snow cone.         Be careful not to add too much flavoring to your frozen treat! The temperature difference could cause your snow cone to melt quickly, turning your snow cone to a slush cone."
3879,Make Snow Cones,4,none,5,Enjoy your flavored ice treat.,"With a paper cone, it's easy enough to eat a snow cone without any utensils. For regular shaped cups or deep cups, you may want to serve your cones with a spoon."
3880,Make Snow Cones,5,none,6,Create a Kool-Aid syrup.,Add 2 cups of sugar and 1 cup of water to a saucepan or small pot. Heat this on your stove on high until the mixture comes to a simmer and the sugar is dissolved. Then add your favorite Kool-Aid to the mix and stir until the Kool-Aid is completely dissolved.         You should wait until your Kool-Aid syrup is completely cooled before you use it. This kind of syrup can often be kept in the refrigerator for up to a month.
3881,Make Snow Cones,6,none,7,Make a natural juice syrup.,"This natural syrup can be made from your choice of fruit juice mixed with water. You should combine the two in a 2 to 1 ratio; 2 parts fruit juice to every 1 part water. For example, for every 2 cups of fruit juice, you should add 1 cup of water.          You may notice that natural syrups have a slightly different taste than out-of-the-box flavors. You may need to thin the mixture with water to make it suit your tastes."
3884,Make Snow Cones,9,none,10,Top your snow cone with a fruit puree.,"Since you've already got the blender out, it should only take you minutes to whip up a fruit puree. Add fresh or frozen fruit to your blender and hit the puree button until your fruit reaches the desired consistency. Then add the fruit to the top of your snow cones.          If you have berry flavored syrups, you might consider making a berry medley puree. Add blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries to your blender, blend, and you'll have a tasty snow cone topper. If you've made a fresh fruit puree, you can freeze this to give it the same consistency as your crushed ice. Simply make your puree and allow this to freeze in your freezer overnight. Depending on how much it hardens, you may need to run it through your blender again."

3902,Make Bone Broth,0,none,1,Use cartilaginous bones.,"Collagen, which is found in cartilaginous bones like the joints, neck, head and feet, renders gelatin. For chicken broth, use 2 chicken feet in addition to the other bones. For beef broth, use sections of a calf's foot. You can find these things at your local butcher, or you can ask your local farmer to bring you some. They freeze well.;"
3903,Make Bone Broth,1,none,2,Use bones with some meat on them.,"This will not affect the gelatin content of your broth, but will increase its flavor immensely."
3904,Make Bone Broth,2,none,3,Add vegetable scraps (if you have them) or even whole vegetables.,"Bone broth is a great way to make use of kitchen “waste”–onion skins, garlic skins, ends of carrots, potato peelings. If you’re making broth weekly, you can store these in the fridge. Otherwise, freeze them for later use. Whole cloves of garlic, halved onions, halved potatoes all add flavor to your broth."
3905,Make Bone Broth,3,none,4,Fill a large stockpot with cold water and add the bones and the apple cider vinegar.,Let sit for an hour.   The vinegar helps to draw out the minerals from the bones.
3906,Make Bone Broth,4,none,5,Place on stove and turn heat to medium-high.,"When the liquid starts to roll, turn down heat immediately to low. At this point, there will be a good amount of foam on the surface of your broth. Skim, skim, skim.   This foam contains surface impurities and will negatively affect the flavor of your broth."

3936,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,0,none,1,Preheat the grill.,"To cook the inside-out cheeseburgers, you’ll want to preheat the grill so you know it’s hot enough when the burgers are ready. Set your grill to medium-high and allow it to heat fully.If you prefer, you can cook the burgers under the broiler in your oven or in a frying pan.;"
3937,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,1,none,2,"Combine the ground beef, pepper, sauce, and paprika.","To season the meat for the burgers, place 2 pounds (907 g) of ground beef into a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (34 g) of Worcestershire sauce, 2 teaspoons (2 g) of paprika, and salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste to the meat. Use clean hands to gently mix the beef with the seasonings until they are thoroughly combined.Be careful not to overwork the ground beef when you’re mixing it. That can result in tough burgers. You can add whatever your favorite burger seasonings are to the ground beef. For example, garlic powder, onion powder, and crushed red pepper are tasty options."
3938,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,2,none,3,Form the beef into 12 thin patties.,"After you’ve mixed the seasonings into the meat, use your hands to gently shape the ground beef into 12 thin, round patties. They should be approximately 3-inches (7.5-cm) in diameter. Set the burgers aside for a moment.If you’re have trouble forming the ground beef into round patties, you may want to use mold to help you get the shape right. The lid from a peanut butter jar or other small jar can work well."
3939,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,3,none,4,Mix the cheese and scallions in a bowl.,"After you’ve made the patties, add 4 ounces (112 g) of shredded sharp cheddar or pepper jack cheese and 1 scallion that’s been finely chopped to a small bowl. Toss the ingredients together so they’re well blended.You can use any type of hard cheese that melts well for the burgers. Swiss, Gruyere, and Monterey jack are tasty options. You can also mix two or more types of cheese for the burgers if you like. If you’re a fan of bacon cheeseburgers, turn these into inside-out bacon cheeseburgers by mixing 4 slices of cooked, crumbled bacon in with the cheese and scallions."
3940,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,4,none,5,Divide the cheese mixture between 6 beef patties.,"Once you’ve mixed the cheese and the scallions, use a spoon to add 1 to 2 tablespoons (7 to 14 g) of the cheese mixture to the center of 6 of the patties that you’ve made. Make sure to leave a ½-inch border around the edges of the patties.It’s important not to overstuff the burgers with the cheese filling or it may leak out when you grill them."
3941,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,5,none,6,Top with the remaining patties and seal closed.,"When you’ve added the cheese mixture to the 6 of the patties, cover them with the remaining 6 beef patties. Press and pinch down along the edges to ensure that they are sealed, so you form a single burger with each pair of patties.Be sure to seal the two patties together all the way around. If there are any openings, the cheese may ooze out during grilling."
3942,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,6,none,7,Flatten the burgers and brush them with oil.,"When you’re ready to grill the burgers, press down on each to flatten it to a 4-inch (10-cm) patty. Use a basting brush to lightly cover each burger with canola oil to prevent it from sticking to the grill.Remember to brush both sides of the burgers with the oil."
3943,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,7,none,8,Grill the burgers on one side.,"Place the burgers on the preheated grill. Allow them to cook on the first side for 3 minutes.While the total overall cooking time for the burgers depends on how done you want them, you should always cook them for 3 minutes on the first side regardless of whether you want them medium-rare or well-done."
3944,Make an Inside Out Cheeseburger,8,none,9,Flip the burgers and cook on the other side.,"Once you’ve cooked the burgers for 3 minutes on the first side, use a spatula to turn them over on the grill.

3948,Make Capirotada,0,none,1,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius).,"Prepare a baking sheet by greasing it with nonstick cooking spray or butter.   For this step, you could line the sheet with parchment paper, instead, if you would prefer an easier clean-up.;"
3949,Make Capirotada,1,none,2,Cut the rolls into thin slices.,"The slices should be about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) thick. Add butter to both sides and arrange them on your prepared baking sheet.   You will end up using roughly half of the butter, or 1/4 cup (60 ml), for this step. Bolillo rolls are a type of Mexican bread available through many market bakeries. If you cannot find bolillo, though, French bread makes an excellent substitution. Both types of bread have crusty outsides and soft insides.For best results, use bread that has been left out or bread that is at least 2 days old. This bread is already somewhat stale, but for a recipe like this, a little extra crispiness is actually preferable."
3950,Make Capirotada,2,none,3,Bake the rolls for 3 minutes per side.,"When ready, both sides should be dry and lightly browned.   Remove the rolls from the baking sheet and let cool. Set aside. Turn the rolls after 3 minutes using tongs. Work carefully to avoid getting burned."
3951,Make Capirotada,3,none,4,"Alternatively, fry the bread.","Toasting the bread in the oven is the contemporary way to prepare the bread, but a more traditional way to prepare it would be by frying it on the stovetop in a cast iron skillet.Melt 1 to 3 Tbsp (15 to 45 ml) of butter in the skillet over medium heat. Make sure that the butter coats the entire bottom of the skillet. Butter both sides of the each slice of bread, as with the oven-toasted method. Add the pieces of bread to the skillet a few at a time. Do not overcrowd the pan. After 3 minutes or so, use a spatula to flip the bread over to the other side. The side that initially faced the pan should be crispy and lightly browned. Give the other side an additional 2 to 3 minutes to cook. When done, that side, too, should be crispy and lightly browned. Note that you may need to add more butter as you go along to keep the bottom of the skillet well-coated."
3952,Make Capirotada,4,none,5,"Combine the water, piloncillo, cinnamon, and cloves in a medium saucepan.","Bring the ingredients to a boil on the stove over high heat.   Piloncillos are cone-shaped pieces of raw, Mexican cane sugar. They are usually available in 4 oz (120 ml) and 9 oz (270 ml) sizes. If you cannot find piloncillo sugar, though, you can use brown sugar, instead. You could also use 1 full cinnamon stick and about 3 whole cloves instead of the ground spices, if desired. Note that these whole pieces of spice will need to be strained out before the syrup can be used, though."
3953,Make Capirotada,5,none,6,Let simmer for 20 minutes.,"Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the syrup simmer for about 20 minutes, uncovered.   Simmering the syrup allows the tastes of cinnamon and cloves to permeate it more thoroughly, ultimately making the final syrup more flavorful."
3954,Make Capirotada,6,none,7,Set aside.,"Remove the syrup from the heat and cover the pan with a lid until ready to use.   If you used whole cinnamon sticks and whole cloves, you should let the entire syrup steep for 1 to 2 hours, giving the flavors more opportunity to disperse throughout the syrup. Pour the syrup through a mesh strainer to remove the whole spices before use."
3955,Make Capirotada,7,none,8,Grease a baking dish with nonstick cooking spray.,"Make sure that the bottom and sides are well-coated.   Use an 11 by 7 by 2-inch (28 by 18 by 5-cm) baking dish. You could use butter or shortening to grease the dish instead of cooking spray, if desired. Note that the oven should still be preheated to a temperature of 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius)."
3956,Make Capirotada,8,none,9,Spread out a layer of toasted bread.,"Layer roughly 1/3 of the toasted bread at the bottom of the pan, arranging it in as even a layer as possible.Try to cover the entire of the bottom in at least one layer, but do not exceed two layers of bread at the bottom."
3957,Make Capirotada,9,none,10,Cover with a layer of apples.,Lay roughly 1/3 of the apple slices over the top of the bread layer.   Some recipes leave this fruit layer out completely. Other recipes use 2 to 3 peeled and sliced bananas instead of or alongside the sliced apples.
3958,Make Capirotada,10,none,11,"Lay out some of the nuts, dried fruit, and cheese.","Sprinkle 1/3 of the nuts, raisins, dried apricots, and shredded cheese over the apple layer.   A traditional Mexican cheese, like Cotija or Queso Añejo, would work best, but you can replace these hard-to-find cheeses with more common options like Monterey Jack, Longhorn Cheddar, and Colby cheese. Additionally, you can use chopped cubes of cheese instead of shredded cheese, if desired. Just know that the cheese will not spread out as evenly when using cubes. Pine nuts, almonds, pecans, walnuts, and roasted peanuts are all good nut options. You can even use a nut blend, if desired. Just make sure that the nuts are chopped into small pieces regardless of the type."
3959,Make Capirotada,11,none,12,Pour some of the syrup over the ingredients.,"Pour 1/3 of the syrup over the bread, apple, and fruit layers. Make sure that the bread at the bottom is well coated in syrup.   Let soak for 15 minutes. By letting the first layers rest, you give the syrup more time to soak into the bread and other ingredients."
3960,Make Capirotada,12,none,13,Repeat with the remaining ingredients.,"Arrange the remaining layers using the same pattern as before, and use 1/3 of the total amount of each ingredient each time. This means that you will have two more full layers after your initial layer.   Let the bread pudding rest for 15 minutes after completing each full layer."
3961,Make Capirotada,13,none,14,"Bake, covered, for 30 to 40 minutes.",Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and place it in the oven long enough to heat it through.   Baking the bread pudding also helps the bread to absorb the syrup more effectively. Combining all the ingredients together before baking also allows the flavors to partially blend together.
3962,Make Capirotada,14,none,15,Uncover and bake for an additional 10 to 15 minutes.,"Remove the foil. Drizzle your remaining butter, about 1/4 cup (60 ml), over the top of the capirotada before returning it to the oven. Let it bake until the cheese is golden brown.   The drizzle of butter is only optional, but it does add a final coating of moisture and flavor to the dish."
3963,Make Capirotada,15,none,16,Serve warm.,"Scoop out the capirotada into individual serving dishes while still warm.   Many people prefer to enjoy their capirotada cold, though. To chill the dish, cover it loosely with aluminum foil and refrigerate it for a few hours. If you have never had capirotada before, try it both ways to determine which version you prefer."

3975,Smoke Beef Ribs,3,none,4,"Remove the fell, or membrane that covers the bony side of the ribs.","You want your smoked beef ribs to be tender, and the fell is tough and sinewy.  Slide a knife beneath the fell so you can peel it off. Grab the loose piece of fell with a paper towel. Pull the fell off."
3976,Smoke Beef Ribs,4,none,5,Season your meat before slow cooking beef ribs.,"You may rub the ribs with dry seasonings or marinade them in your favorite sauce.  Make a dry rub out of sugar, salt, spices and/or herbs. Soak your ribs in a marinade. When smoking meats, an acidic marinade will act as a tenderizer. Acidic sauces include citrus fruit or vinegar. Let the ribs set overnight so that they will soak up the seasoning."

3980,Smoke Beef Ribs,8,none,9,"Add alder, cherry, cedar, plum, maple or hickory blocks or chips to the water or put them on the charcoal.",You will need at least 4 cups (946.35 ml) wood chips and 5 to 6 wood blocks when smoking beef ribs.
3981,Smoke Beef Ribs,9,none,10,Check the temperature with a thermometer.,"When slow cooking meat, it is imperative that you have a thermometer to monitor the temperature of the smoker. When the temperature reaches 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107.22 C), you may begin cooking your ribs."
3982,Smoke Beef Ribs,10,none,11,Put your ribs in the smoker and secure the lid.,"When smoking meat, you need an airtight system so the smoke will penetrate the food."
3983,Smoke Beef Ribs,11,none,12,Check the temperature of the smoker and adjust air vents and temperature controls to maintain the smoker at 225 degrees Fahrenheit (107.22 C).,"If necessary, add more charcoal to the smoker."
3984,Smoke Beef Ribs,12,none,13,Shorten smoking time by covering the ribs with aluminum foil after they have cooked for 2 hours.,"Smoked beef ribs may take 6 to 8 hours to prepare, and if you're in a hurry, wrapping the ribs will shorten the cooking time."
3985,Smoke Beef Ribs,13,none,14,Test the ribs after smoking them for an additional 3 hours.,"Cut a piece of meat off with a knife, and if the smoked ribs are tender, they are done. If they are still tough, put them back in the smoker for another 30 minutes to 1 hour."
3987,Cook Pork Shoulder,1,A,A2,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius).,"While waiting for your pork shoulder to warm, it's a good idea to let the oven warm up (especially if yours is slow to heat). If your pork is frozen and defrosting, you may need to wait until the end of the defrosting process to turn on your oven."
3988,Cook Pork Shoulder,2,A,A3,Set the pork on a rack in a roasting pan.,"Use a cooking rack to ensure the pork does not sit in its own juices as it cooks. An oven-safe pan can collect the pork's juices as they drain during cooking - you can dispose of these after cooking or use them for gravy, etc.   Place the pork on the rack fat side up. As the pork cooks, the fat will render and liquefy, running down the pork. Essentially, this allows the pork to baste itself."
3989,Cook Pork Shoulder,3,A,A4,Score the pork.,"Use a sharp knife to cut a criss-cross pattern of slices into the top of your pork shoulder. This serves multiple purposes, allowing the pork's juices to spill out and baste the meat during cooking and allowing your seasonings to penetrate deeper into the meat."
3990,Cook Pork Shoulder,4,A,A5,"Coat the pork with your favorite seasonings, marinade or rub.","Be very generous with your seasonings - much of the roast pork shoulder's flavor comes from its delicious outer crust, the flavor of which is determined by the seasonings you choose. There are a very wide variety of rubs and seasonings suitable for pork shoulders. Some can be store-bought, while others can be recreated at home.   When in doubt, a simple rub of salt, pepper, garlic, and a few basic spices of your choosing (especially thyme and coriander) works great. If you can't get the seasoning to ""stick"", try rubbing the pork shoulder with a light coating of olive oil first. To marinate your pork, you'll want to submerge the pork in a solution that usually contains oil, one or more acidic ingredients, and the seasonings of your choice. The acidic ingredients ""cut"" the oil in the marinade, providing flavor and keeping the finished product from becoming too greasy. Let the pork sit in the marinade for at least 4 hours and as long as a day or more.  Additionally, you may want to consider using the sample dry rub and marinade recipes above."
3991,Cook Pork Shoulder,5,A,A6,Roast the pork shoulder for approximately 1 hour per pound.,"Pork shoulder is best when it's cooked long and slow. Roast uncovered in the oven for about 1 hour per pound of meat. You may reduce the heat as needed if the pork appears to be cooking too quickly - many recipes call for 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius) rather than 350 (177 C).   As a general rule, when pork shoulder is done, the skin should be crispy, the meat should reach an internal temperature of 160-185 degrees (70-85 degrees Celsius), and any bone in the meat should ""wiggle"" easily when grabbed and shaken."
3992,Cook Pork Shoulder,6,A,A7,Let the pork rest for 10 to 15 minutes before carving.,"Like many cuts of meat, pork is best if it's given a ""rest"" after being taken out of the oven. Letting the meat rests allows it to continue to cook off of its internal heat and also allows it to re-absorb moisture that might otherwise be lost if the meat is cut immediately after removing from the oven.   After the brief rest, you're done. Enjoy your delicious roast pork shoulder!"
3994,Cook Pork Shoulder,8,B,B2,Heat skillet over medium-high heat.,"As you wait for your pork shoulder to warm, set a frying pan or skillet on the stove top. When it's hot enough that beads of water flicked into the pan boil up instantly, add a few tablespoons of oil."
3995,Cook Pork Shoulder,9,B,B3,Brown pork shoulder in the skillet.,"Add your cut of pork shoulder to the skillet. Cook in oil over high heat until brown on all sides (this can require several minutes for each side). Slow cookers like crock pots use moist heat and therefore can't give the pork a delicious ""crust"" on their own, which makes it necessary to crisp the exterior of the pork in a pan before slow cooking."
3996,Cook Pork Shoulder,10,B,B4,Add seasonings and/or vegetables to the crock pot.,"Delicious as a cut of pork shoulder can be on its own, if you're using a slow cooker to braise your pork to moist, delicious perfection, you'll want to make sure it's not alone in the pot. Vegetables and seasonings add their flavor to the pork (and vice versa), increasing the complexity of the flavor in the dish. In addition, slow cooked ""stew""-style vegetables make a great side dish for pork.   Feel free to add any vegetables you like. Chopped onions, garlic, carrots, and potatoes all work well. Additionally, any seasonings are fair game. For Latin-flavored carnitas, you might try cumin, garlic powder, and pepper, while for a more European flavor, you might try sage, rosemary, and thyme."
3997,Cook Pork Shoulder,11,B,B5,Cover the pork (and other ingredients) with the liquids of your choice.,"Place the pork shoulder into the crock pot on top of the other desired ingredients. Sprinkle any seasonings you're using over the pile of ingredients. Then, cover 1/2 to 3/4 of the pork shoulder with liquid. This can be a variety of things - water, unsweetened apple juice, beer, or, commonly, stock are all frequent choices. Make your choice based on what pairs well with the ingredients and seasonings in your pork dish - there's no one ""right"" answer. Feel free to mix and match!   As an example, if you're making the carnitas described above, you might try slow cooking your pork in Mexican beer for a delicious, complex taste. Also, when you're picking liquids for slow cooking, it's important to remember that the leftover liquid can be used as a sauce or gravy for the finished pork."
3998,Cook Pork Shoulder,12,B,B6,Cook at a low heat for 8 to 10 hours.,"Place the cover on the crock pot and begin the lengthy slow cooking process. Slow cooking allows plenty of leeway in terms of cooking time, but, generally, you'll want to cook for roughly 2 hours per pound of meat. Check several times during cooking, adding more liquid if needed.   The pork shoulder is done when it is very tender and pulls apart with little effort."
3999,Cook Pork Shoulder,13,B,B7,"For pulled pork dishes, use forks to pull pork apart before serving.","Many slow cooked pork shoulder dishes (like carnitas, etc.) are eaten as ""pulled"" pork - meat torn into shredded bits. To make pulled pork, open the slow cooker when the meat is done and use two forks or kitchen tongs to pull the pork apart. Continue ""pulling"" as needed to achieve a satisfactory shredded texture."
4008,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,0,none,1,"Prepare the onions, garlic and chillies.","Place the onion, garlic and the serrano chiles on a clean, dry cutting surface. Peel and quarter 1 onion, split 4 chiles in half down the center saving the seeds, and smash 4 garlic cloves with the flat side of a chef's knife. Set the vegetables aside while you prepare the pork shoulder.;"
4009,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,1,none,2,Cut the pork shoulder.,"Use a sharp knife to cut the shoulder into strips approximately 2 inches (5.1 cm) in length and 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. Don't remove the fat; during the cooking process, it melts with the meat and causes it to be deliciously tender.   If you'd prefer to cook the pork shoulder whole, that's fine too. Skip this step and follow the rest of the instructions using the entire piece of pork."
4010,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,2,none,3,Toss the pork shoulder pieces with spices.,"Place the pieces in a bowl and pour the spices over them. Use tongs or your hands to toss the pork pieces with the spices until they're completely coated. Add a liberal amount of salt and pepper and toss to coat.   You can get creative with the spices in this recipe. If you like your meat extra spicy, add 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. Don't skimp with the salt; you can add up to 2 teaspoons."
4011,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,3,none,4,Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.,
4012,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,4,none,5,Brown the pork shoulder.,"Place a heavy dutch oven on the stove. Put a few teaspoons of oil in the dutch oven and turn the burner to medium high. When the oil is hot, put the pork shoulder pieces in the dutch oven. Cook them on one side until they get brown, then use tongs to turn them over and brown the other side.   Don't cook the pieces too long. You don't want to cook them through, just enough to bring out the flavor in the meat. Remove the dutch oven from heat when you're finished."
4013,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,5,none,6,Add the vegetables to the pot.,Arrange them around the meat pieces so that they make contact with the bottom of the pot. Pour in an inch or two of water and cover the pot.
4014,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,6,none,7,Cook the carnitas.,"Place the pot in the oven and let the carnitas cook for 4 hours. Check the pot a few times during the course of cooking to make sure the meat isn't drying out or burning. Remove the dutch oven from the oven when the carnitas are meltingly soft when poked with a fork.If you'd prefer to cook the carnitas in a slow cooker, transfer the meat and vegetables to a slow cooker and cook on high for 4 hours, or on low for 8 hours. If the carnitas look like they could use some moisture during the course of cooking, add 1/2 cup of water. Don't remove the carnitas until they are completely tender; cooking the carnitas for a shorter period of time will leave you with tough meat."
4015,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,7,none,8,Serve the carnitas as a main course.,"Place the carnitas on a plate with shredded lettuce, diced tomatoes, a section of lime, some cilantro, and chopped onions. Serve with warm tortillas and some sour cream."
4016,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,8,none,9,Make carnitas tacos.,"Fill taco shells or soft taco tortillas with few spoonfuls of carnitas. Top with the taco toppings of your choice, such as salsa, guacamole, lettuce, cotija cheese, and black beans."
4017,Prepare Mexican Carnitas,9,none,10,Make carnitas enchiladas.,"Fill tortillas with carnitas, then roll them up and line them on the bottom of a deep baking dish. Pour red or green enchilada sauce over the rolls, then top with grated cheese. Bake the enchiladas for 20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly. Serve with sour cream and lettuce."

4019,Cook Puy Lentils,1,A,A2,Rinse and clean the lentils.,"Place the lentils into a medium bowl and fill it with enough water to cover the lentils. Use your hand to comb through the lentils. Pick out any organic debris or other matter that you find. When you’ve gone through the batch, drain the lentils through the sieve.  While uncommon, there are sometimes pebbles or small stones hiding in lentils that can hurt or break teeth."
4020,Cook Puy Lentils,2,A,A3,Combine the ingredients.,"In a medium saucepan, combine the lentils and bay leaf. Add enough water to cover the lentils by about three inches (7.6 cm). To add extra flavor and depth to the lentils, you can also add other ingredients, such as:  Herbs Spices Garlic Minced onions"
4021,Cook Puy Lentils,3,A,A4,Cook the lentils.,"Put the lid on the pot and heat the lentils over medium-high heat. Bring the water to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to medium-low. Remove the lid and cook the lentils for about 25 minutes. Add more water as necessary to ensure the lentils stay covered.  The lentils are ready when they are tender, and when there's no crunchiness left when you bite into them."
4022,Cook Puy Lentils,4,A,A5,Strain and salt the lentils before serving.,"When the lentils are tender, remove the pot from the heat. Drain the water by pouring the lentils into the sieve. Return the lentils to the pot and add the salt. Stir to coat the lentils before serving.  You can also garnish the lentils with other herbs and spices, such as pepper, rosemary, thyme, and sage."
4023,Cook Puy Lentils,5,B,B1,Assemble your supplies and ingredients.,"Lentil salad is a basic dish that combines cooked lentils with spices, cooked vegetables, and a vinaigrette. Before starting, soak your lentils in water and pick out any rocks or organic matter that you find. Drain the lentils before cooking. You'll also need some supplies, including:Medium saucepan Stirring spoon Frying pan Medium bowl Whisk Fine-mesh sieve"
4024,Cook Puy Lentils,6,B,B2,Boil the lentils.,"Place the lentils into a medium saucepan with the bay leaf and thyme. Fill the pan with water so the lentils are under about three inches (7.6 cm) of water. Bring the pan to a boil over medium heat. When it boils, reduce the heat to low and add a pinch of salt. Continue simmering for 20 to 25 minutes.  The lentils are ready as soon as they become tender. To test them, pick out a lentil with a spoon and crush it between your teeth. If it’s soft and easy to mash, the lentils are ready."
4025,Cook Puy Lentils,7,B,B3,Drain the lentils.,"When the lentils are cooked and tender, remove them from the heat. Place your sieve in the sink, and carefully drain the lentils through to remove the excess water.  Return the drained lentils to the saucepan. Place the lid back on and set them aside as you prepare the vegetables and vinaigrette."
4026,Cook Puy Lentils,8,B,B4,Cook the vegetables.,"In a large frying pan, combine the cooking oil, carrot, onion, and fennel. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Heat the pan over medium heat, stirring regularly. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 10 minutes.  You can also add one to two cloves of crushed garlic to the mixture as well.Reserve the minced shallot, which will be used in the vinaigrette."
4027,Cook Puy Lentils,9,B,B5,Make the vinaigrette.,"In a medium bowl, combine the red wine vinegar, olive oil, and mustard. Whisk them together until the vinaigrette starts to thicken. Whisk in the minced shallot.Dijon mustard is recommended for this dish, but you can use any type of mustard you like."
4028,Cook Puy Lentils,10,B,B6,Toss the ingredients together.,"Combine the cooked vegetables, lentils, and vinaigrette together in the saucepan you cooked the lentils in. Stir to incorporate everything and coat the lentils and vegetables in the dressing.  As you stir the ingredients together, pick out the bay leaf and thyme that you cooked with the lentils."
4029,Cook Puy Lentils,11,B,B7,Serve the salad warm.,"Allow the salad to cool to warm or room temperature before serving. You can drizzle some olive oil over the finished dish if you like, and season with more salt and pepper, to taste.  You can also let the lentils cool completely and toss them with lettuce or chopped fresh herbs. Good herb pairings include thyme, savory, and parsley."
4030,Cook Puy Lentils,12,C,C1,Soak the lentils.,Pour the lentils into a heat-safe bowl and add enough boiling water to cover them by an inch (2.5 cm). Set the bowl aside and let the lentils soak in the boiling water for about 15 minutes.  This will par-cook the lentils so they’ll be tender when the soup is done.
4031,Cook Puy Lentils,13,C,C2,Cook the vegetables and spices.,"Pour the oil into a large stockpot and heat it over medium heat for two minutes. Add the onion, garlic, leek, salt and pepper (to taste), thyme, and cumin. Cook the vegetables and spices for about 20 minutes, stirring regularly.  When the onions and leeks are tender, add the celery and carrots. Cook for another 10 minutes, stirring regularly."
4032,Cook Puy Lentils,14,C,C3,"Cook together with the stock, paste, and lentils.","Strain the lentils and add them to the pot with the vegetables and spices. Add the stock and the tomato paste, and stir to combine all the ingredients. Put on the lid and bring the mixture to a boil over high heat. When the soup boils, reduce the heat to medium and remove the lid.  Let the soup simmer on medium heat for an hour, until the lentils are tender. Stir the soup every 15 minutes to prevent burning."
4033,Cook Puy Lentils,15,C,C4,Add the red wine vinegar and seasoning.,"When the lentils are tender, add the final ingredient. Taste the soup, and add more salt and pepper, to taste. You can also use an immersion blender to puree a quarter of the soup and give it a thicker consistency.To use a blender, transfer about 2 cups of the soup to a blender. Puree the soup and stir it back in with the rest of the pot."
4034,Cook Puy Lentils,16,C,C5,Garnish with Parmesan and serve hot.,"Serve the soup as soon as you’ve seasoned it to your liking. You can drizzle each serving with a bit of olive oil if you like, and garnish the top of each bowl with some freshly grated Parmesan cheese."
4036,Make Coconut Yogurt,1,A,A2,Combine the cream and other ingredients.,"Scoop out the cool, thick coconut cream and place it in a large bowl. Add the probiotics and sweetener, then whisk until well-combined and smooth.   Do not use the watery portion of the coconut milk sitting at the bottom of the can. Using it would result in very thin yogurt. If using probiotic capsules, open the capsules and use the powder inside. You could also use 2 tsp (10 ml) probiotic powder, 2 Tbsp (30 ml) store-bought coconut yogurt, or 2 Tbsp (30 ml) fermented coconut water probiotic kefir. Raw sugar works well as a sweetener, but you could easily use the same amount of maple sugar, raw honey, or agave. If you prefer less-sweet yogurt, you can omit the sweetener altogether."
4037,Make Coconut Yogurt,2,A,A3,Transfer the mixture to sterilized jars.,"Pour the coconut mixture into a clean, sterilized glass jar. Tightly seal the jar with a lid.   It's important to use sterilized jars since bad bacteria will ruin the yogurt if it creeps inside. You can sterilize the jars using a dishwasher or boiling water."
4038,Make Coconut Yogurt,3,A,A4,Ferment the yogurt for 24 hours.,"Place the sealed jars of yogurt into your oven. Leave the oven off, but turn the oven light on. Allow the yogurt to sit in the oven for 12 to 24 hours.   A closed oven with the light on will maintain a stable temperature between 105 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40 to 43 degrees Celsius), which is ideal for the fermentation process. Do not turn the oven on since doing so will make the interior too hot, which will likely kill the probiotics.The yogurt will become thicker with a longer incubation period. You should give it a minimum of 12 hours, but 24 hours would be ideal."
4039,Make Coconut Yogurt,4,A,A5,Refrigerate until cool.,"Remove the thick, fermented yogurt from the oven and transfer it to your refrigerator. Chill the yogurt for approximately 6 hours, or until it becomes thoroughly cool.   If the yogurt separates during this period, you can recombine the layers by stirring them together. You can also make the yogurt thicker by pouring off the liquid layer and using only the thickened layer beneath it."
4041,Make Coconut Yogurt,6,B,B1,Combine the coconut milk and thickener.,"Shake the coconut milk, then open the cans and pour them into a medium saucepan. Add your thickener of choice to the coconut milk.   Unlike coconut yogurt prepared without a thickener, you'll need to use the full can of coconut milk. Thoroughly shaking the cans before opening them should help combine any separated cream and water. If you use agar agar, sprinkle the flakes over the coconut milk without stirring them. If you use tapioca starch, whisk 1/3 cup (80 ml) of coconut milk with the tapioca until the starch dissolves. Pour this mixture back into the rest of the coconut milk and stir to combine."
4042,Make Coconut Yogurt,7,B,B2,Heat the coconut mixture.,"Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Allow the coconut milk to reach a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for an additional 5 to 10 minutes.After the coconut milk begins simmering, you should periodically whisk the mixture to incorporate the thickener into the milk. Continue heating the coconut milk until the agar agar fully dissolves or the tapioca fully thickens the milk."
4044,Make Coconut Yogurt,9,B,B4,Add the probiotics and sweetener.,"Sprinkle the probiotics and sweetener over the surface of the milk, then whisk well to combine.   If you use probiotic capsules, you should open the capsules and only use the powder inside. Alternatively, you could use 4 tsp (20 ml) of probiotic powder, 4 Tbsp (60 ml) store-bought coconut yogurt, or 4 Tbsp (60 ml) fermented coconut water probiotic kefir. You can swap out the raw sugar for another sweetener, like maple syrup or agave, or omit it altogether if desired."
4045,Make Coconut Yogurt,10,B,B5,Pour the yogurt into sterilized jars.,"Pour the coconut mixture into sterilized glass jars. Seal the jars with tight lids.   The jars must be sterilized before use; otherwise, bad bacteria could get into the mixture and spoil your yogurt. Sterilize the jars by running them through the hottest cycle of your dishwasher or by soaking them in boiling water for several minutes."
4046,Make Coconut Yogurt,11,B,B6,Ferment the yogurt for 12 to 24 hours.,"Place the yogurt in an empty oven. Turn the oven light on, but leave the oven itself off. Allow the yogurt to ferment in this warm environment for 12 to 24 hours.   Do not turn the oven on since extremely hot temperatures can kill the probiotics. A closed oven with the light on should maintain temperatures between 105 and 110 degrees Fahrenheit (40 and 43 degrees Celsius), which is ideal for the culturing period. Allowing the coconut yogurt to sit for 24 hours will produce thicker yogurt, but most should be ready after 8 to 12 hours."
4047,Make Coconut Yogurt,12,B,B7,Refrigerate the yogurt.,"Transfer the jars of yogurt to the refrigerator and let them chill for approximately 6 hours.   During this time, the yogurt should continue thickening and the fermentation process should cease. If the yogurt separates, you can stir it to combine the layers. For thicker yogurt, however, strain the liquid and use only the thickened bottom layer."
4049,Make Coconut Yogurt,14,C,C1,Chill the coconut milk.,"Place the cans of coconut milk in your refrigerator and allow them to sit overnight, or for at least 8 hours.Refrigeration will help separate the coconut cream from the water. If you prefer working with fresher ingredients, you can use fresh coconut meat instead of canned coconut milk. Combine 2 cups (500 ml) fresh coconut meat with 1/2 cup (125 ml) coconut water or filtered water, blending until smooth. You can use this blend immediately; no refrigeration is required."
4050,Make Coconut Yogurt,15,C,C2,Scoop out the solidified cream.,"Open the cans of coconut milk and scoop out the solidified cream sitting on top. Discard the watery portion sitting in the bottom of the can.   Do not shake the cans before opening them since doing so will combine the cream and water, resulting in watery yogurt."
4051,Make Coconut Yogurt,16,C,C3,Blend the ingredients together.,"Place the solidified coconut milk in your blender or food processor. Add the lemon juice, probiotic, and salt. Blend the ingredients together until well-combined and very smooth.   Open and empty the probiotic capsules; do not add whole capsules to the blender. If you don't have probiotic capsules, you could use 1 tsp (5 ml) probiotic powder or 1/4 cup (60 ml) coconut water probiotic kefir."
4052,Make Coconut Yogurt,17,C,C4,Adjust as desired.,"Taste the yogurt. Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of liquid sweetener, if desired, and blend the yogurt again until the sweetener is evenly distributed.   Maple syrup, agave, coconut nectar, and natural liquid cane sugar are all good choices. If the yogurt is too thick for your preferences, you could also add 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of coconut water or purified water to thin it out."
4055,Make Candied Bacon,0,none,1,Preheat the oven to 350 (176.6 Celsius) degrees.,"Wait for the oven to preheat, about 15 minutes."
4056,Make Candied Bacon,1,none,2,Prepare the baking sheet.,"Cover the bottom of a large baking sheet with aluminum foil or parchment paper, and place a wire cooling rack on top. The foil or parchment paper will catch any mess, which will make cleaning up much easier.If you don't have a wire rack, just cover the baking sheet in parchment paper. A rack will make your bacon crispier, but you can still make candied bacon without one."
4057,Make Candied Bacon,2,none,3,Mix the glaze ingredients.,"Add the sugar, rice vinegar, and maple syrup in a large bowl. Stir until all ingredients are fully mixed."
4058,Make Candied Bacon,3,none,4,Place the bacon on the wire rack and put the tray in the oven.,"Take the bacon and place it on top of the wire rack. Space each slice out evenly, making sure that none of them are overlapping.If you don't have a wire rack, just place the bacon on the baking sheet. Don't add the glaze just yet: first you will partially cook the bacon."
4059,Make Candied Bacon,4,none,5,Bake the bacon for ten minutes.,Place the baking tray with the bacon in the center of the oven. Allow it to cook for ten minutes.
4060,Make Candied Bacon,5,none,6,Turn the bacon slices.,"After ten minutes, take the tray out of the oven carefully with an oven mitt. Brush the top of the bacon with the sugar glaze. Use a pair of tongs or a small spatula to flip over each slice of bacon. Then brush glaze onto the other side of the bacon."
4061,Make Candied Bacon,6,none,7,Bake for another five minutes.,"Put the tray back in the oven and let the bacon bake for five more minutes. After five minutes, take the tray out of the oven and use a basting brush to brush the glaze on both sides of the bacon. Then put the bacon back in the oven.Basting the bacon builds up the sugar glaze on the outside."
4062,Make Candied Bacon,7,none,8,Keep basting the bacon.,"Remove the bacon from the oven after another five minutes. Baste each side of the bacon with the sugar-maple syrup glaze. Repeat basting every five minutes or so until the bacon looks done. The total baking time should be around 35 minutes.If you aren’t sure whether the bacon is done, break off a small piece and see if it’s crispy enough for you."
4063,Make Candied Bacon,8,none,9,Allow to cool for 5 minutes.,"After the bacon is cooked, take the tray out of the oven. Carefully lift up the wire rack with the bacon on it and set it on the counter. This will stop the heat radiating from the tray and cooking the bacon further. Let the bacon sit for five minutes, then use a small spatula to remove the bacon from the wire rack. Put the bacon slices on a tray. Sugared bacon can be served warm or at room temperature."
4064,Make Shrimp Cocktail,0,none,1,Prepare court bouillon for a tastier shrimp cocktail.,"You've probably heard of bouillon cubes, right? They're added to hot water to make it more flavorful. Although you certainly don't need to make court bouillon, the addition of wine, herbs, and other seasonings takes this shrimp cocktail dish a couple steps closer to perfection.;"
4065,Make Shrimp Cocktail,1,none,2,"Add all the ingredients to a large, covered pot and bring to a boil.",Don't worry about tying a bouquet garni. Just plop everything into your pot and bring to a boil. Stir once or twice to make sure that all the ingredients are well incorporated. Allow the court bouillon to boil for 20 extra minutes for a more intensely flavored broth.
4066,Make Shrimp Cocktail,2,none,3,"While the court bouillon is coming together, assemble your cocktail sauce.","In a medium bowl, mix together ketchup, chili sauce, horseradish, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and salt. Stir until evenly mixed."
4067,Make Shrimp Cocktail,3,none,4,"Once mixed, cover cocktail sauce with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator.",Allow to chill while the shrimp cook.
4069,Make Shrimp Cocktail,5,none,6,Cook shrimp with their shells if possible.,"It's a little bit of hassle to peel the shell from the shrimp at the end of the day, but the taste makes up for it. Shrimp with their tails and shells still on are said to taste better.Another option is to cook your shrimp with shells and tail on, and then peel them after cooking is complete. Look for shrimp that are ""ready to peel."" This simply means that they've been de-veined, so that you don't have to go through the hassle of removing their guts. If you want to de-vein shrimp yourself, check out this handy tutorial."
4070,Make Shrimp Cocktail,6,none,7,Place the shrimp in the court bouillon and cook until their skin turns opaque.,"How you cook your shrimp will depend on two things: whether they are fresh or frozen, and how large they are.   Fresh jumbo shrimp will take about 5 minutes to cook. Once they turn from translucent to opaque, they're ready to take out. Frozen (uncooked) shrimp generally take a bit longer. If you put them in the water, wait for the water to come back to a boil and then test one; they're usually finished when the water has returned to a boil. You can also defrost your shrimp first in cold water to make the cooking process go faster."
4071,Make Shrimp Cocktail,7,none,8,"When the shrimp have finished cooking, remove them from the court bouillon and shock them in the ice bath for 30 second.",Shocking shrimp in the ice bath will halt the cooking process and keep them from becoming rubbery.
4072,Make Shrimp Cocktail,8,none,9,Remove the shrimp from the ice bath with a slotted spoon and drain off thoroughly.,Make sure the shrimp aren't wet before you assemble them.
4073,Make Shrimp Cocktail,9,none,10,"Assemble your shrimp, with or without shell, next to your bowl of homemade cocktail sauce.",A classic placement is to surround your cocktail sauce with shrimp and lemon wedges on a bed of ice.

4081,Make Wonton Soup,7,none,8,Create the wontons.,"Take the mixture out of the refrigerator and prepare the wonton wrappers. Place a wrapper diagonally on your cutting board with one point facing you so that it looks like a diamond.   Place a teaspoon of the filling in the middle of the wonton. Dip your finger in the slurry mixture and stir it a bit then taking a finger full of it and coating the edges of the wonton. Bring the bottom corner of the wonton up to the top corner, pressing down lightly, sealing the edges. Dab more slurry on the bottom corners of the triangle. Lift the wonton up with one corner of the triangle pointing up and bring the bottom two corners together and press lightly."
4082,Make Wonton Soup,8,none,9,Boil the wontons.,Add a little salt to a pot of boiling water and then add the wontons to the water. Avoid overcrowding the pot. Cook them until they float to the surface and stir often to keep them from sticking together. Remove the wontons after about 3 to 5 minutes.
4083,Make Wonton Soup,9,none,10,Put the wontons in a large bowl and then add a 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil to the bowl.,Stir them together so that the wontons don't stick to each other. Pour 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth in the bowl and sprinkle with green onions.
4084,Make Bun Bo Hue,0,none,1,Start with the broth.,"Most of the flavor comes from the beef and pork bones; they are the perfect tool for making hearty broths. The ideal broth takes around 3 hours to complete.   Wash the pork and beef bones with water. Place them into a stock pot until bones are fully covered. Boil the meat for about 10 minutes. Remove the fat from the pot as it rises to the top. Empty the pot, rinse the meat, and then place into a different pot. Smash and bruise the 8 stalks of lemongrass for the the stock. 6-8 stalks should be good; too much will make the stock bitter. You can use a meat tenderizer or simply anything hard enough to smash the stalk.;"
4085,Make Bun Bo Hue,1,none,2,Add water to the pot and all the ingredients for the broth.,"This includes the cleaned meat, beef ox tail, a couple cloves of garlic, the bruised lemongrass stalks, a knob of ginger, 1 quarter of a pineapple, 1 tbsp of salt, fish sauce, and the fermented shrimp paste. Turn the stove on high.   Wait until the broth boils and skim and then dump the fat the rises to the top. Turn the stove down from medium-low and let it simmer for about 3 hours. Make sure the pot is covered so the broth can absorb all the flavor. Remove the meat from the pot. Shred it from the bone and add it back in."
4086,Make Bun Bo Hue,2,none,3,Prepare your other meats for the soup.,"Slice beef shank into quarter-inch pieces. Wash the pig feet and pig toes (the pig feet come pre-sliced). Slice your pork loaf into 1 inch pieces and set aside.Add the beef shank and pig feet into the stock pot. Wait about 30 minutes until that meat is tender and remove the excess fat, as before. Turn the stock pot back on low-medium heat."
4087,Make Bun Bo Hue,3,none,4,Make the lemongrass saute.,"In different pan on medium heat, add 2 tbsp of cooking oil and 1 tbsp of annatto seeds. When the color of the seeds have seeped into the oil to make it dark red, remove the seeds. Chop and mince 2 stalks of lemongrass. Add that to the pan. Saute it for about a minute; this releases the fragrance.  Add 2 Tbsp of fermented shrimp paste and 1 Tbsp of chili paste to the pan. Saute this mixture until the texture becomes smooth (about 7-10 min). Transfer this mixture into the stock pot. This will give the broth a vibrant red color at the top. You can add more chili paste to make the broth more spicier, if desired."
4088,Make Bun Bo Hue,4,none,5,Boil the noodles as directed on the package in a different pot.,"Then drain the water, rinse and set the noodles aside when cooked; that way the noodles won't stick."

4090,Make Bun Bo Hue,6,none,7,Check to see if the pork feet are done.,"If so, add the sliced pork blood into the broth. You can tell if the pig feet are done by poking them with a chopstick.  You can buy the pork blood pre-cooked (if you don't find this satisfying you can still add it in to enhance the flavor)."
4091,Make Bun Bo Hue,7,none,8,Turn the heat on the stock pot medium-high until you see a rolling boil.,"While you wait, you can add noodles to your boil along with the pork loaf. Add the broth and whatever meats you like into your bowl.Add whatever garnish you like afterwards. It's traditionally added after your pour the broth in your bowl."
4094,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,1,none,2,Mix your flavorings together.,"In a small bowl, add the soy sauce, liquid smoke, maple syrup, and paprika. Use a fork or wire whisk to beat the ingredients together. When you're done, you should be left with an even consistency."
4095,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,2,none,3,Drizzle the coconut flakes with the seasoning.,"Place your coconut flakes in a separate bowl. Drizzle the flavoring over them. Toss the bowl gently so the coconut flakes get evenly coated with the flavoring.Choose a bowl that's large enough to leave a lot of headspace at the top after adding your flakes. This way, coconut flakes will not fall out while tossing your flakes."
4096,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,3,none,4,Spread your flakes on the baking tray.,"Make sure to spread the flakes in an even layer. You do not want any of the flakes on top of one another, as this will prevent them from cooking. Once you have an even layer of flakes, your coconut flakes are ready to bake.Make sure to wash your hands before handling the flakes."
4097,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,4,none,5,Bake the flakes for 12 to 14 minutes.,"Remember the oven should be set to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (or 177 degrees Celsius). If you prefer softer bacon, bake the flakes for 12 minutes. If you want crispier bacon, bake them for 14 minutes."
4098,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,5,none,6,Flip the flakes and finish baking them.,"Halfway through the baking process, you should flip the flakes. Watch them closely as they bake for an additional 12 to 14 minutes. When done, they should be just brown and crisp on the edges. Coconut can go from brown to burnt quickly, so be vigilant about checking."
4099,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,6,none,7,Remove the flakes and let them cool.,"After the flakes are golden brown, remove them from the oven. Set them aside to cool for a few minutes. You can use them immediately or store them in your fridge.You can also place them in an airtight container and store them in the fridge for several months."
4101,Make Fake Bacon Using Coconut,8,none,9,Use the flakes in a Cobb salad.,"A Cobb salad can be a healthy, nutritious lunch, which is easy to make vegan or vegetarian with coconut flakes. You can add all the main ingredients, such as Romaine lettuce, a vinaigrette, and things like tomatoes and avocados, and then swap out regular bacon for veggie bacon.Some ingredients commonly used in a Cobb salad, like blue cheese and eggs, are not vegan.

4103,Make Calzones,0,none,1,Combine the ingredients.,"Place the flour, sugar, yeast, and salt in a mixing bowl. Use a stand mixer or a hand mixer to mix the ingredients. Keep the mixer running while you add the water and 2 tablespoons of the oil. The dough will be sticky at first, but should soon form into a ball.         If the dough seems too dry, add 1 teaspoon of water at a time to moisten it until it forms a ball. If the dough seems too sticky, add 1 teaspoon of flour at a time until it holds its shape.;"
4104,Make Calzones,1,none,2,Knead the dough.,Turn the dough onto a floured work surface. Use your hands to knead the dough until it comes together into a firm ball. The surface of the dough should begin to look smooth and a little shiny.
4105,Make Calzones,2,none,3,Let the dough rise.,"Rub a large bowl with a few teaspoons of olive oil so the inside is thoroughly coated. Place the dough ball into the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set the bowl in a warm part of the kitchen. Let it rise until it has doubled in size, which should take 1 - 2 hours."
4106,Make Calzones,3,none,4,Rest the dough.,"Remove the dough from the bowl and punch it down. Divide it into 8 parts, one part for each calzone you want to make. Set the dough pieces on a tray, cover it with plastic wrap, and let them rest for 10 minutes.          If you want to make larger calzones, divide the dough into fewer parts. For more calzones, divide the dough into smaller parts. At this point you can place the dough in the refrigerator and use it at a later time, or go ahead and complete the calzone recipe."
4108,Make Calzones,5,none,6,Sauté the onions and garlic.,"Add the onions to the skillet and sauté them until they become translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for one minute more."

4112,Make Calzones,9,none,10,Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.,
4113,Make Calzones,10,none,11,Roll out the dough.,Remove the plastic wrap from the tray of dough pieces. Place the first piece of dough on a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it into disc shape. Continue until all the dough pieces are rolled into discs.
4114,Make Calzones,11,none,12,Add the filling.,"Spoon filling into the center of each disc of dough. The filling should take up about 1/3 of the dough; don't add so much that it spreads to the edges, as this will prevent the calzones from cooking properly."
4115,Make Calzones,12,none,13,Fold and pinch the dough.,"Lift one side of a dough circle and fold it in half over the filling. Use your fingers or a fork to crimp the dough where the edges meet, so that you now have a half-moon shaped calzone. Repeat with the remaining dough circles."
4116,Make Calzones,13,none,14,Bake the calzones.,"Lay the calzones on a greased baking sheet. Use a fork to poke a hole in the top of each calzone. Brush the calzones with a little olive oil.

4145,Cook with Morels,3,A,A4,Rinse the morels in cold water.,"There may be dirt and debris hidden in the morels’ crevices so it’s important to rinse them before cooking. Place the morels in a colander, and rinse them under cold water at the sink.After you rinse the mushrooms, shake the colander well and pat the morels dry with paper towel to remove any excess moisture."
4147,Cook with Morels,5,A,A6,Chop the mushrooms lengthwise.,"For most recipes, you’ll want to cut the morels in half. However, you should cut the mushrooms lengthwise to open up their hollow centers. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut them down the middle lengthwise before cooking with them.In most dishes, cutting the morels in half is fine. However, if you like, you can quarter them lengthwise if you prefer."
4149,Cook with Morels,7,B,B1,Fill a small bowl with boiling water.,"To rehydrated dried morels, you’ll need a small bowl that’s large enough to hold all of the mushrooms. Fill the bowl with enough boiling water to cover the morels.If you prefer, you can use warm chicken stock or cream to rehydrate the morels. In most cases, 3 ounces (85 g) of dried morels usually equals a pound (454 g) of fresh mushrooms."
4150,Cook with Morels,8,B,B2,Add the mushrooms and let them soak for at least 15 minutes.,"After you’ve filled the bowl with hot water, add the morels to it. Allow them to sit in the hot water for at least 15 minutes, or until they’re soft and pliable.You can also tell that the morels have soaked long enough if they no longer crack when you bend them."
4151,Cook with Morels,9,B,B3,Drain the morels with a colander or sieve.,"When the morels are finished soaking, dump the bowl out into a colander or sieve. Shake the mushrooms well to ensure that you remove the excess moisture.You may want to reserve the soaking liquid from the morels. It has plenty of flavor, so you can mix it into recipes for extra seasoning or use it as a base for soups and sauces. If the liquid has dirt in it, strain it through a sieve or coffee filter to remove the debris."
4152,Cook with Morels,10,B,B4,Rinse the mushrooms if they still seem gritty.,"After you’ve drained the morels, run your fingers over them. If they feel gritty, place them in a colander or sieve and rinse them under cool water before cooking with them.Be sure to dry the morels thoroughly before cooking with them."
4153,Cook with Morels,11,C,C1,Heat the oil.,"Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil to a large skillet. Heat the oil on high until it begins to shimmer, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.For the best results, use a cast iron or stainless steel skillet to saute the morels. You can substitute canola oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer."
4154,Cook with Morels,12,C,C2,Add the mushrooms and cook until they’re browned.,"Once the oil is heated, add 8 ounces (227 g) of morel mushrooms that have been cleaned, trimmed, and cut in half to the skillet. Allow the mushrooms to cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until they are well browned.Occasionally stir and toss the mushrooms as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly."
4155,Cook with Morels,13,C,C3,Lower the heat and add the shallots and garlic.,"When the mushrooms are browned, reduce the heat on the stove to medium-high. Mix in a small minced shallot and a minced medium garlic clove, and let the mixture cook until it becomes fragrant, which should take 45 seconds to minute.If you’re not a fan of garlic, you can leave it out of the dish. If you enjoy a strong garlic flavor, you can increase the amount to 2 or 3 cloves."
4156,Cook with Morels,14,C,C4,"Mix in the butter, soy sauce, lemon juice, and chicken stock.","After the morel mixture has become fragrant, add 2 tablespoons (28 g) of unsalted butter, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of soy sauce, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and ¼ cup (59 ml) of low-sodium chicken stock to the skillet. Allow the mixture to cook until the liquid reduces and a creamy sauce develops, which should take approximately 1 minute.You can use store-bought or homemade chicken stock. If you prefer, you can substitute water for the chicken stock."
4157,Cook with Morels,15,C,C5,Stir in the parsley and season with salt and pepper.,"Once the morels are coated in a creamy sauce, mix in 1 tablespoon (4 g) of minced fresh parsley. Season the dish with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste, and serve it while it’s still hot.You can substitute fresh chives or chervil for the parsley."
4158,Cook with Morels,16,D,D1,Cut the morels in half.,"For the creamy morel sauce, you’ll need 2 cups (150 g) of fresh morel mushrooms. Rinse them under cold water, and use a knife to cut any large mushrooms in half.It’s best to cut the morels in half lengthwise."
4159,Cook with Morels,17,D,D2,Melt the butter in a pan.,"Add 1 tablespoon (14 g) of butter to a medium saucepan. Heat it on medium until it melts, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute olive oil for the butter."
4160,Cook with Morels,18,D,D3,Cook the shallot until it’s translucent.,"Once the butter is melted, add a large minced shallot to the pan. Allow it to cook on medium until it becomes translucent, which should take approximately 1 minute.If you don’t have a shallot, you can substitute a sweet onion, such as Vidalia."
4161,Cook with Morels,19,D,D4,Mix in the morels and season with salt and pepper.,"When the shallot has cooked long enough to become translucent, add the morels. Next, stir in some salt and freshly ground black pepper to season the mixture."
4162,Cook with Morels,20,D,D5,Add the chicken stock and bring the mixture to a boil.,"After you’ve seasoned the mixture, mix in 1 cup (237 ml) of chicken stock. Raise the heat to high, and allow the mixture to come to a full boil, which should take 3 to 5 minutes.You can substitute vegetable stock for the chicken stock if you prefer."
4164,Cook with Morels,22,D,D7,Stir in the cream and thyme and simmer.,"Once the mixture has reduced, add 1 cup (237 ml) of heavy cream and ½ teaspoon (½ g) of finely chopped, fresh thyme. Turn the heat down to medium high, and simmer the sauce until it reduces by a third, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute sage, savory, or marjoram for the thyme if you prefer."
4165,Cook with Morels,23,D,D8,"Season the sauce with salt, pepper, and lemon juice.","When the sauce has thickened, mix in some more salt and black pepper to taste. Next, stir in 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice, and serve immediately.The creamy morel sauce makes a delicious pasta sauce or a topping for roast chicken, veal, or fish. You can even ladle some over mashed potatoes or toasted bread."
4167,Cook with Morels,25,E,E2,Melt the butter in a pan.,"Add 3 tablespoons (42 g) of butter to a large saucepan. Heat it over medium-high heat until the butter melts, which should take approximately 5 minutes.You can substitute olive oil for the butter if you prefer."
4168,Cook with Morels,26,E,E3,Saute the morels and onion.,"Once the butter has melted, add the morels and a large, chopped onion to the pan. Allow the mixture to cook until the morels and onion become tender, which should take 5 to 6 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture occasionally as you saute it to ensure that it cooks evenly."
4169,Cook with Morels,27,E,E4,Add the flour.,"When the mushrooms and onion are tender, sprinkle 2 tablespoons (16 g) of all-purpose flour over the mixture. Stir well to thoroughly blend in the flour."
4170,Cook with Morels,28,E,E5,"Mix in the milk, bouillon, thyme, salt and pepper.","Once the flour is mixed in, add 4 cups (946 ml) of milk, 3 teaspoons (8 g) of chicken bouillon granules, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, and ⅛ teaspoon (¼ g) of black pepper. Stir well to ensure that all of the ingredients are fully combined.Whole milk will create the creamiest soup, but you can use 2% milk if you prefer. If you like, you can also mix some dried sage into the soup."
4171,Cook with Morels,29,E,E6,Bring the mixture to a boil and allow to cook for a couple of minutes.,"When all of the ingredients are combined, raise the heat to high. Bring the mixture to a boil, and then allow it to cook for 2 minutes.Be sure to stir the soup the entire time that it’s boiling."
4174,Make a Fruit Burrito,0,A,A1,Finely chop all the fruits and remember to take out the eyes of the pineapple and save 10 strawberries for another preparation.,;
4175,Make a Fruit Burrito,1,A,A2,"On a tortilla, put some of the cheese mix and spread it around.",

4178,Make a Fruit Burrito,4,A,A5,Sprinkle a little cheese on the cilantro and roll the burrito in the standard way.,Now Heat the burrito on both the sides to heat and cook the cheese and to allow all the flavors to mix properly.
4188,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,0,A,A1,Place the roast and broth in the slow cooker.,"Place the venison roast in your slow cooker. Pour 2 cups (500 ml) of beef broth over it evenly.   If you do not have beef broth, you could use venison stock, beef stock, chicken stock, or vegetable broth. In a pinch, you could even use water.;"
4189,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,1,A,A2,Cover the roast with butter.,"Cut the butter into small chunks and distribute it evenly over the surface of the roast.   If the butter has been softened, smear it over the top and sides of the meat. If the butter is still hard, however, simply distribute the chunks of butter over the surface as evenly as possible to distribute the flavor."
4190,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,2,A,A3,Add the seasonings.,"Combine the garlic, salt, pepper, paprika, thyme, and rosemary in a small bowl. Sprinkle this blend of spices and herbs evenly over the top and sides of the roast.   If you want the seasonings to penetrate the meat even further, consider using your hands to rub the seasoning blend into the meat. This works best if you are also using softened butter since you can spread both the butter and the seasonings over the surface at the same time."
4191,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,3,A,A4,Add the vegetables.,"Spread the diced onion over the top of the roast. Layer the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots on top, as well.   Even if you choose not to prepare the roast with vegetables, you should still add the onion. Many people claim that the pungent onion flavor masks the ""gamey"" taste of a deer roast. If you prefer crisp, firm vegetables, you can wait until the final 2 hours of cooking time before adding the cubed potatoes and chopped carrots. The onion should always be added at this time, however."
4192,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,4,A,A5,Cook on low for 8 to 10 hours.Cover the slow cooker and switch it to low.,"A thawed roast should take about 8 hours, but a frozen or partially frozen roast will need a full 10 hours.   Alternatively, you could switch the slow cooker on high and leave it for 6 hours."
4193,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,5,A,A6,Serve warm.,"Once the roast has finished cooking, remove it from the slow cooker and carve it into portion-sized chunks. Serve the potatoes and carrots on the side."
4194,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,6,B,B1,Cut the roast into slices.,Use a sharp knife to cut the venison roast into slices that are roughly 2 inches (5 cm) thick.   Cutting the roast into slices will make it easier to keep the meat submerged under the sauce as it cooks. You should also remove any visible fat and connective tissue as you cut the roast into slices.
4203,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,15,B,B10,Serve warm.,"When done, switch the slow cooker to warm and serve the shredded venison directly from the appliance.   Enjoy the shredded venison on sandwich buns, on top of mashed potatoes or noodles, or in any way you would usually serve shredded barbecue meat."
4204,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,16,C,C1,Cut the venison into cubes.,"Use a sharp knife to cut the venison roast into 1-inch (2.5-cm) cubes.During this time, you should also trim any visible fat or connective tissue you see."
4205,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,17,C,C2,Coat the venison in flour.,"Place the flour in a shallow bowl. Toss the venison cubes in the flour, rolling and turning them as needed until all sides are coated.   You could also do this by placing the flour and venison in a large resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag and shake it vigorously to coat all the pieces."
4206,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,18,C,C3,Heat the oil in a skillet.,"Pour the oil into a large skillet and heat it on medium-high for a minute or so.   The oil should become visibly thinner. Do not allow it to become hot enough to smoke, though. For a richer flavor, replace the oil with butter."
4207,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,19,C,C4,Brown the venison cubes.,"Place the coated cubes of venison roast in the skillet of hot oil. Cook, turning frequently, until lightly browned on most sides.   Browning the cubes of meat before adding them to your slow cooker deepens the flavor. The oil or butter also adds fat to the otherwise lean meat, which will help the meat stay tender and moist during the cooking process."
4208,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,20,C,C5,Place the deer meat in a slow cooker.,"Dump the contents of the skillet into your slow cooker, dispersing the venison evenly over the bottom of the appliance.   Do not drain the excess oil. Pour it into the slow cooker along with the meat."
4209,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,21,C,C6,Add the vegetables.,"Layer the cubed potatoes, diced carrots, chopped celery, and chopped onion on top of the meat.   You can alter or omit the vegetables you use, but you should always include onion since the pungent onion flavor helps mask the ""gamey"" taste of venison."
4210,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,22,C,C7,Pour in the broth.,"Pour enough broth over the contents of the slow cooker to completely cover the venison.   You do not need to keep all of the vegetables submerged, but the meat itself needs to be submerged if you want it to remain moist. If you do not have beef broth, chicken broth, vegetable broth, venison stock, or water can be used, instead."
4211,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,23,C,C8,Cook on high for 6 hours.,"Cover the slow cooker and cook it on high for 6 hours, or until the vegetables and cubes of meat are tender enough to fall apart.   If you want to prolong the cooking time, switch the slow cooker on low and cook the stew for 8 to 10 hours."
4212,Cook a Deer Roast in a Slow Cooker,24,C,C9,Serve warm.,Switch the slow cooker to warm and serve the venison roast stew directly from the appliance.

4216,Cook a Heritage Turkey,3,none,4,"Spread your favorite seasonings onto the outside of the bird, under the skin and in the cavity.",You can also add cut up fruits or vegetables to place in the cavity while cooking for additional flavor.
4217,Cook a Heritage Turkey,4,none,5,Place the turkey on the rack in a roasting pan so it does not sit in its own juices and put it in the hot oven.,Add water with herbs or broth to the bottom of the pan for added flavor while cooking.
4218,Cook a Heritage Turkey,5,none,6,Check the turkey with a meat thermometer in the deepest part of the thigh.,"The internal temperature should reach 150 to 165 degrees Fahrenheit (66 to 74 degrees Celsius), though the USDA recommends 180 to 185 degrees Fahrenheit (82 to 85 degrees Celsius). The reason for the difference is the way the birds are raised; they are far less likely to carry bacteria."
4219,Cook a Heritage Turkey,6,none,7,Let the roasted turkey rest for about 15 minutes before carving.,

4240,Make Jelly Beans,0,none,1,"Combine water, sugar, and gelatin.","Place the water, granulated sugar, and gelatin in a large saucepan. Stir to combine."
4241,Make Jelly Beans,1,none,2,Boil the mixture.,"Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat. Allow the gelatin mixture to reach a boil, stirring frequently.  You'll need to stir the mixture with a wooden or plastic spoon as it heats up. Otherwise, the gelatin granules may gather together and form lumps. Once the mixture reaches a boil, use a wet pastry brush to wash down the sides of the pan. Doing so removes any sugar clinging to the sides and creates a smoother syrup."
4242,Make Jelly Beans,2,none,3,Cook to 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius).,"Insert a candy thermometer into the mixture as soon as it reaches a boil. Continue cooking the syrup until it reaches a temperature of 230 degrees Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius).With the stove heat set to medium, this process should take 20 to 25 minutes. Do not allow the syrup to reach temperatures much higher than this. If it does, the resulting jelly beans will become hard instead of chewy."
4246,Make Jelly Beans,6,none,7,Pour the syrup into the molds.,"Use a spoon to carefully fill each mold indentation with the flavored syrup.  Try to fill each mold completely. While it might create a mess, over-filling the molds will ultimately be better than under-filling them since the beans will be difficult to remove from under-filled molds."
4248,Make Jelly Beans,8,none,9,Remove the beans from the molds.,"Invert the mold and press on each indentation from the bottom side. Doing so should cause the jelly beans to pop out.  Since the beans are so sticky, they may not pop out immediately. If the beans do not pop out, you can use a small spoon to dig them out of their molds. Most should hold their shape even if pressed in this manner."
4249,Make Jelly Beans,9,none,10,Coat the beans with cornstarch.,"Place the jelly beans in a bowl and add the cornstarch. Toss to coat, then allow them to sit for at least four hours.  The corn starch should absorb some of the remaining moisture, making the beans easier to handle. After drying the beans, you many need to toss them into a sieve to help shake away any excess cornstarch. This won't always be necessary, though, since much of the cornstarch will be absorbed by the beans."
4250,Make Jelly Beans,10,none,11,Combine the corn syrup and food coloring.,"Pour the corn syrup into a small bowl and stir in several drops of food coloring. Continue stirring until the color is evenly dispersed.If desired, you could also add a few drops of liquid flavoring. Make sure that the flavoring matches or accents the flavor used for the chewy inner portion of the bean."
4257,Make Focaccia,0,none,1,Prepare a clean surface on which to handle the dough.,"This can be a bread board or a wooden table, but make sure to wash the surface thoroughly, since it will be in direct contact with the dough. If you will use a table that gets used for other purposes, wipe it with dish soap and then wipe again to rinse, as you would a dish.  Now is a good time to tie up long hair and wash your hands, too.;"
4258,Make Focaccia,1,none,2,Run some warm water into a stoneware bowl.,"Real yeast is not difficult to handle, but it will help if you keep it warm. A good rule of thumb with yeast is that it will like the temperatures you would like in a warm bath. Some warm water from the tap will preheat the bowl nicely, and stoneware, if you have it, will help to hold that heat."
4259,Make Focaccia,2,none,3,Chop finely the rosemary and any other herbs you wish to add to the dough.,

4267,Make Focaccia,10,none,11,"Knead the dough by hand for about ten minutes, working in any remaining flour.","If in doubt, knead longer than you think you need to. It is difficult to over-knead by hand. Sprinkle flour on top of the dough as needed to keep your fingers from sticking. Kneaded dough should be springy and smooth when it is ready. See if it bounces back when you poke a finger into it. Also try the ""earlobe test"". Pinch an earlobe-sized piece of dough and see if it feels about like an earlobe."
4268,Make Focaccia,11,none,12,Shape the kneaded dough into a round ball.,
4269,Make Focaccia,12,none,13,Pour a little olive oil into the bowl.,
4270,Make Focaccia,13,none,14,Roll the dough around in the bowl to coat the surface.,Turn the ball of dough over and roll it to coat the other side.

Place the formed meatballs on a plate or tray.Consider using a melon baller or small ice cream scoop to help you form evenly sized, evenly shaped meatballs.

If you don't want to dirty another pan, place the formed meatballs onto a large sheet of aluminum foil."
4369,Make Turkey Meatballs,7,B,B3,Heat the oil in a deep skillet.,"Pour the olive oil into a large skillet with deep sides. Set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat.   The skillet should have sides that are at least 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10 cm) high. Skillets that are 12 inches (30.5 cm) in diameter will usually be large enough to accommodate all of the meatballs.

Using a hot pan will make it harder for the meatballs to stick later on."
4370,Make Turkey Meatballs,8,B,B4,Brown the meatballs.,"Place the meatballs in the hot oil.

Wait for each side to brown before attempting to turn the meatball since doing so will reduce the amount of sticking that occurs."
4371,Make Turkey Meatballs,9,B,B5,Add the tomato sauce.,"Once the meatballs appear browned on all sides, reduce the heat to medium and pour in the tomato sauce. Cover the pan and simmer the meatballs for another 10 minutes, or until the insides are no longer pink.   Spread the tomato sauce throughout the entire skillet and turn the meatballs over so that all sides come into contact with the sauce. Note that there should be enough sauce to nearly cover the meatballs."
4372,Make Turkey Meatballs,10,B,B6,Serve as desired.,"You can serve the cooked meatballs and sauce directly from the skillet while the dish is still warm. Pair them with pasta, rice, bread, or salad greens.   Alternatively, you can store the meatballs in their sauce by placing them in an airtight container. They should stay good for up to three days when stored in the refrigerator, or up to three months when stored in the freezer."
4373,Make Turkey Meatballs,11,C,C1,Combine the meatball ingredients.,"Place the turkey, egg, bread crumbs, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.

For instance, consider using minced onion instead of garlic or parsley instead of oregano and basil."
4374,Make Turkey Meatballs,12,C,C2,Form the mixture into meatballs.,"Use your hands to separate the turkey mixture and roll each portion into 1-inch or 2-inch (2.5-cm or 5-cm) diameter balls.

4376,Make Turkey Meatballs,14,C,C4,Heat the oil.,"Pour the olive oil into a large skillet and set the pan on your stove over medium-high heat. Allow the oil to heat and spread for at least 30 to 60 seconds.   You'll need to brown the meatballs before placing them into your slow cooker. Do not skip the browning step.

4389,Make Broccoli Cheese Soup,8,none,9,Puree the soup.,"Working in batches, transfer the soup to a blender and puree it until smooth. When the soup has been blended, transfer it back to the large stock pot and turn the heat to medium.          If you wish to keep whole pieces of broccoli and vegetables in the soup, you can either skip the pureeing stage or just puree half the batch. Use an immersion blender if you have one, so you don't have to transfer the soup out of the pot."
4390,Make Broccoli Cheese Soup,9,none,10,Stir in the cheese.,Add the grated cheese to the hot soup. Use a spoon to stir it in and allow it to completely melt. Taste the soup for flavor. The soup is finished when the cheese has melted and the flavors have melded.

Next, add ¼ cup (50 g) of chopped ham to the pot, and allow it to cook for 1 minute, stirring regularly.You can replace the ham with bacon if you prefer. You can collect bacon fat any time you fry up some bacon. Pour the fat and grease that’s left in the pan in a jar and store it in your refrigerator. The fat will solidify, but you can just scoop out a few tablespoons when you need them."
4396,Make Red Beans and Rice,4,none,5,"Stir in the onions, celery, bell peppers, and seasonings.","After you’ve cooked the ham briefly, add 1 ½ cups (240 g) of chopped yellow onions, ¾ cup (80 g) of chopped celery, and ¾ cup (112 g) of chopped green bell peppers to the pot.

If the beans get too thick or dry, add more stock or water. Only add ¼ cup (59 ml) at a time, though, so you don’t make the mixture too thin."
4401,Make Red Beans and Rice,9,none,10,Take off the heat and mash some of the beans.,"When the beans have simmered for a couple of hours, remove the pot from the burner.

4409,Cure Salmon,0,none,1,"Choose a fat, fresh filet.","Curing salmon brings out the best in its fishy flavor, and little subtleties like the salmon's fat content and freshness will stand out after the curing process. The fresher and fattier the salmon, the better your gravlax will taste, so choose the highest quality salmon possible.   Check the salmon's labeling. Look for sustainably-sourced salmon that was not previously frozen. It's easier to find this while salmon is in season during the summer months. Salmon that has been frozen and thawed will not taste as good after curing. To make enough for eight servings, get a two-pound salmon filet with the skin still attached. The flesh should be bright orangish-pink and firm. The skin should look bright and shiny, not spotted or damage. Buy the salmon the same day you're planning to start the curing process, if possible. Store it in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.;"
4410,Cure Salmon,1,none,2,Choose your alcohol.,"It's increasingly popular to rub alcohol over the fish before coating it in a cure. Using vodka, bourbon, rye or another alcohol is not traditional when it comes to the lox you'd get in a deli for your bagel, but it can add a lot of depth during the curing process. If you wish to use alcohol, you'll only need a few tablespoons, enough to rub over the entire filet before you coat it in the cure."
4411,Cure Salmon,2,none,3,Mix up a cure.,"The most basic ingredient of a salmon cure is salt. Salt draws the moisture from the fish's flesh, changing the taste and texture and acting as a natural preservative. Sugar, spices and citrus zest may be added to provide extra flavor. Start with a basic cure the first time you cure salmon, then consider getting creative and adding your favorite spices and alcohol for a different flair the next time around. Use the following ratio of ingredients for one two-pound piece of salmon:   1/2 cup kosher salt (not table salt, which can negatively affect the flavor) 3 tablespoons white sugar 3 tablespoons of the fresh chopped herbs of your choice, like oregano, dill, basil, fennel or a combination 1/2 tablespoon white pepper Optional: 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) lemon zest"
4412,Cure Salmon,3,none,4,Rinse and dry the salmon.,"When you're ready to star the curing process, remove the salmon from the refrigerator and rinse it in cool water, then dry it thoroughly with paper towels."
4413,Cure Salmon,4,none,5,Lay the salmon on several sheets of plastic wrap.,The salmon will need to be tightly wrapped in plastic as it cures. Tear off a few large sheets of plastic wrap and place them on a baking sheet. Lay the salmon fillet skin-side down in the center of the plastic.
4414,Cure Salmon,5,none,6,Check the salmon for pin bones.,"Gently press into the flesh of the filet with your fingertips to feel for tiny pin bones. They're usually located near the center of the filet. It's important to remove these before curing the salmon, since they'll interfere when it comes time to slice it up. When you come upon a bone, use a needle-nosed plier to pry it from the flesh, taking care not to damage the filet too much as you do so. Discard the bones when you're finished."
4415,Cure Salmon,6,none,7,Dress the salmon filet.,"Time to apply the alcohol and cure mixture to the salmon to begin the curing process. Use enough to cover the filet on both sides. Err on the side of using too much instead of too little, since you can always rinse off the excess flavoring later.   Rub the salmon with alcohol. Use a tablespoon or two of the alcohol you chose to cover the salmon on both sides. No need to rub it in with pressure; instead, just smooth it over the surface. Apply the cure. Use a spoon to sprinkle a good coating of the cure mix over the entire filet. Flip it over and put more on the other side."
4416,Cure Salmon,7,none,8,Wrap the salmon tightly.,Lift the sides of the plastic wrap and wrap up the salmon so that it's tightly covered with no air holes. You may want to get another piece of plastic wrap to make sure the wrapping is secure.
4417,Cure Salmon,8,none,9,Weight the salmon.,"Place a second baking sheet over the first one. Nest it in so it's sitting directly on top of the salmon. If you don't have a sheet that fits perfectly, find another flat-surfaced pan or dish to do the job. Put a heavy bowl, a brick, or heavy canned goods on top of the entire contraption. This will compress the cure ingredients into the salmon, creating the right conditions for it to cure."
4418,Cure Salmon,9,none,10,Refrigerate the salmon for 72 hours.,"During this time, do nothing to the salmon except wait patiently while it cures. Most chefs recommend three days of refrigeration, though some recipes specify curing for two. It's a matter of taste, so if you prefer salmon that's less salty, go for two instead of three."
4419,Cure Salmon,10,none,11,Unwrap and rinse the fish.,"Remove it from the refrigerator and take off the plastic wrap. Rinse the fish under cool running water, washing away the salt and other cure ingredients. If you skip this step, the fish will taste too salty."
4420,Cure Salmon,11,none,12,Slice the salmon.,"Use a very sharp knife to cut thin horizontal slices from along the top of the salmon (rather than slicing it vertically as you would a steak). Gravlax has a strong flavor, so thinner slices are more palatable. The salmon is now ready to enjoy.   Taste the salmon for flavor. If you find it too salty, give in an extra rinse before continuing to slice it. The classic way to serve gravlax is with a fresh bagel, cream cheese, sliced red onion and capers. It also makes a great topping for salads, pizzas, crostini, pasta and more."

4432,Make Moroccan Chorba,1,A,A2,Wash and cut the vegetables.,"Wash two onions, two medium-sized tomatoes, and two large white potatoes. Carefully use a sharp knife to slice the onions thinly. Set the onion aside while you dice the potatoes into 1-inch (2.5 cm) long pieces. Get out a box grater and grate the two medium tomatoes. Set these aside while you prepare the chorba.It's fine to mix the grated tomatoes with the diced potatoes, since they'll be added to the chorba at the same time."
4433,Make Moroccan Chorba,2,A,A3,Saute the onions and chicken wings.,"Place a large saucepan on the stove and pour in 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Heat the oil over medium-high and stir in the finely sliced onions and 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of chicken wings. Stir in 2 teaspoons of turmeric, 1 teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of ground black pepper and a generous pinch of saffron threads. Cook the mixture for 10 minutes and stir it occasionally. The chicken should brown slightly.The turmeric and saffron give the chorba its distinctive yellow-gold color."
4434,Make Moroccan Chorba,3,A,A4,Add the chickpeas and simmer the chorba.,"Drain the soaked chickpeas and add them to the saucepan. Stir in 6 1/3 cups (1.5 liters) of water. Bring the chorba to a boil and turn the heat down to medium-low. Put the lid on the pot and simmer the chorba for about 40 minutes.If you're using canned chickpeas, you can just measure out the 1 1/4 cups (300 g) of chickpeas and add them to the saucepan."
4435,Make Moroccan Chorba,4,A,A5,"Add the grated tomatoes, paste, and potatoes.","Remove the lid and stir in the grated tomatoes, 1 1/2 tablespoons of tomato paste, and the diced potatoes. Stir the chorba and turn the heat up to medium-high. The soup should come back to a boil."
4436,Make Moroccan Chorba,5,A,A6,Simmer the chorba.,Turn the heat down to medium-low and put the lid back on. Let the chorba bubble gently for 15 minutes. This will help the chickpeas soften more and cook the potatoes a little.
4437,Make Moroccan Chorba,6,A,A7,Stir in the broken spaghetti and parsley.,Measure out 3.5 ounces (100 g) of spaghetti and break them into 2-inch (5 cm) long pieces.

Let the chorba simmer until the noodles are cooked (about 7 to 9 minutes).Serve the chorba with extra chopped parsley and flatbread.
4438,Make Moroccan Chorba,7,B,B1,Chop the vegetables.,"Wash a small onion, one stalk of celery, and rinse fresh flat-leaf parsley. Carefully use a sharp knife to finely chop 1/4 cup (40 g) of onion, 1/4 cup (55 g) of celery, and 2 tablespoons of the parsley. Set the vegetables aside."
4439,Make Moroccan Chorba,8,B,B2,Season and brown the lamb.,"Pour 3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large saucepan. Heat the oil over medium-high. Sprinkle salt and freshly ground black pepper over 1 pound (453 g) of trimmed, diced boneless lamb shoulder. Add the lamb to the saucepan and cook it until it's browned all over.Stir the lamb as it browns to keep it from sticking from the pan."
4440,Make Moroccan Chorba,9,B,B3,"Add tomato puree, water, and harissa.","Scoop 1/2 cup (115 g) of the canned tomato puree into the saucepan along with 1/2 cup of water and 3 tablespoons of harissa. Stir the chorba mixture and let it cook for a few minutes.If you can't find harissa, you can use any spicy chili paste."
4441,Make Moroccan Chorba,10,B,B4,"Add the remaining vegetables, puree, and water.","Stir the chopped onion, celery and parsley into the saucepan. Stir in the remaining 2 cups (450 g) of canned tomato puree and 3 cups (709 ml) of water.You can easily add other vegetables or leftover broth, depending on what you have in your refrigerator."
4442,Make Moroccan Chorba,11,B,B5,Simmer the chorba.,"Once the chorba begins to bubble, reduce the heat to low and put the lid on. Let the chorba simmer for about 20 minutes. The lamb will become tender and the vegetables will soften."

Turn the heat up to medium-high, so the chorba begins to boil. Gradually pour in ¾ cup (150 g) of fine pearl barley while you stir the chorba.If you don't have fine pearl barley, you can use millet or orzo."
4444,Make Moroccan Chorba,13,B,B7,Cook the barley and season the chorba.,Continue to cook the chorba on medium-high for another 10 minutes. This will give the pearl barley a chance to cook. Taste the chorba and adjust the seasonings.You can serve the chorba with sliced lemon.

4453,Make Alfajores,8,none,9,Finished.,
4457,Roast a Leg of Lamb,3,none,4,Have the fat trimmed.,"If the butcher hasn't already trimmed away the fell, a thick cap of fat that encases the leg, have them do so. If you roast the lamb leg with the fell, it will be more likely to taste of mutton, and it will be less tender. However, don't have the butcher remove all of the fat. Keeping some of the fat intact will help to flavor the lamb and keep it moist."
4459,Roast a Leg of Lamb,5,none,6,Preheat the oven to 400 °F (204 °C).,
4460,Roast a Leg of Lamb,6,none,7,Rub the meat with spices.,"Lamb is so tender that it doesn't need to be marinated. You can follow a recipe to marinate the lamb, but it's easier to complement the meat's flavor with a simple rub. First, rub olive oil and a few tablespoons of lemon juice all over the lamb. Then, sprinkle the leg with salt, pepper and 3 tablespoons or so of your favorite spices. Try the following, either alone or in combination:   Crushed rosemary Dried thyme Dried sage Minced garlic"
4461,Roast a Leg of Lamb,7,none,8,Place the lamb in a roasting pan.,Use a pan that's just slightly larger than the leg.
4462,Roast a Leg of Lamb,8,none,9,Roast the lamb for 30 minutes.,Roasting for the first 30 minutes at a high heat will give the lamb a nice sear.
4463,Roast a Leg of Lamb,9,none,10,Reduce the heat and continue roasting.,"Turn it down to 350 °F (177 °C) for the remainder of the roasting time. Roast for another 30 minutes to an hour or more, depending on your preferred level of doneness. No matter what, use a meat thermometer to check the meat's temperature after about an hour to see how the lamb is progressing. Here are the general guidelines for roasting times:"
4464,Roast a Leg of Lamb,10,none,11,"Rare meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 125 °F (52 °C), which will require about 15 minutes per pound.","Medium-rare meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 130 °F (54 °C), which will require about 20 minutes per pound.  Medium meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 135 °F (57 °C), which will require about 25 minutes per pound.  Well done meat: roast until the internal temperature of the meat is 155 °F (68 °C), which will require about 30 minutes per pound."
4465,Roast a Leg of Lamb,11,none,12,Remove the lamb from the oven and let it rest.,"Give it at least 15 minutes before you start carving the meat. This allows time for the lamb's juices to absorb back into the leg, which will make the meat more flavorful and moist."
4466,Roast a Leg of Lamb,12,none,13,Carve the lamb.,"If you used boneless lamb, simple cut it into 1-inch thick slices. For bone-in lamb, set the leg on a cutting board. Make perpendicular cuts an inch apart down the length of the leg, using a sharp knife to cut until the knife hits the bone. Stand the leg on its tip and use the knife to cut parallel to the bone so that the meat falls off in slices."
4467,Roast a Leg of Lamb,13,none,14,Serve the lamb with sauce.,"Leg of lamb is traditionally served with a mint sauce or a gravy. The tender meat tastes delicious with a complementary sauce, and these choices don't take much extra time to make.    To make mint sauce, blend 2 cups fresh mint leaves, 1/4 cup olive oil, 2 garlic cloves, 2 tablespoons lemon juice and 1/4 cup plain yogurt in a blender. Pour over the lamb slices.  To make lamb gravy, pour the drippings from the roasting pan into a small saucepan and heat it to medium high. Add 1 chopped onion and sauté until translucent. Add 1 cup chicken stock and 1/2 cup wine, and simmer until it thickens. Season with salt and pepper. Pour over the lamb slices to serve."
4469,Make Bacalhau,0,none,1,Soak 2 pounds of dried salted cod in cold water for 24 to 36 hours.,Soaking the fish in cold water removes the salt from the surface of the fillets. Place 2 pounds of dried salted cod in a dish. Cover the fish in cold water and place the dish in the fridge. Change the water every 8 hours.   You may change the water more frequently if desired.;
4470,Make Bacalhau,1,none,2,Boil the desalted cod for approximately 5 minutes.,"Fill a large pan with water and bring it to a boil. Add the fish to the water. After five minutes, remove the cod from the water. If the cod flakes easily when pulled with a fork, it is done. If it does not flake, return it to the boiling water.   Save the water to boil the potatoes."
4471,Make Bacalhau,2,none,3,"Descale, debone, and flake the fish.","Place the fish on a cutting board. With a sharp knife, carefully remove the skin and bones from the pieces of cod. Once the visible scales and bones are removed, start flaking, or pulling apart, the cod with a fork. As you flake the fish, remove any bones or scales you come across.   Keep the pieces bite sized or larger."
4472,Make Bacalhau,3,none,4,Create a seasoning for the cod.,"In a small bowl or glass measuring cup, mix together the following ingredients:   ¾ cup olive oil 1 clove finely chopped garlic 1 ½ teaspoons red pepper flakes 1 tablespoon freshly chopped parsley Black pepper to taste"
4473,Make Bacalhau,4,none,5,Season the cod.,Place the flaked cod in a clean bowl. Pour the seasoning mixture over the cod and toss. Set the cod aside.
4475,Make Bacalhau,6,none,7,Boil the potatoes until tender.,Turn on the burner and bring the pot of fish water and potatoes to a boil. This takes approximately 20 to 25 minutes.
4476,Make Bacalhau,7,none,8,"Drain, cool, peel, and slice the potatoes.","Pour the contents of the pan into a colander. Set the potatoes aside to cool. Once cool, remove the peel from the potatoes. Cut the potatoes into ¼ to ½ inch slices.If you peeled the potatoes first, just slice the potatoes once cool."
4477,Make Bacalhau,8,none,9,Thinly slice two yellow onions and sauté in butter.,"As the potatoes are cooking, melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. While the skillet heats up, finely slice two yellow onions. Add the onions to the pan and sauté until caramelized. Once the onions have browned, stir in one clove of chopped garlic.   Turn off the burner and remove the onion-garlic mixture from the skillet."

4484,Make Akara,1,none,2,Peel the beans’ skins off.,"This takes effort but is important for the texture. To peel the beans by hand, begin by draining the beans after they have finished soaking. Reserve the water you used to soak the beans in another bowl. Rub the beans vigorously between your hands in small batches. The bean skins should come off. Run water over the beans to wash the skins off if necessary. Drop the beans back into the water and the skins should float to the surface. Individually pick out any beans with the skins still on and peel them."
4485,Make Akara,2,none,3,Try using a blender to peel the beans more quickly.,"Begin by dropping a handful of the soaked beans into the blender. Next, pour water into the blender until it is at twice the level of the beans. Press the “Pulse” button on your blender for 1 second, then let go. Repeat 4 more times and pour the beans into a large bowl with the water. Repeat this process for the rest of the beans, then drain the beans with a colander. The bits of skin should drain with the water. If they do not, submerge the beans in water again and any leftover skins should float to the surface. You can also pick the leftover skins off with your fingers."
4487,Make Akara,4,none,5,"Grind the beans with the chili pepper, onions, salt, and white pepper.","You can use a mortar and pestle, blender, or food processor for this step. Grind in batches if your blender, food processor, or mortar is too small to fit all of the beans at once. Add small amounts of water during the grinding process to make sure that the paste sticks together. When you’re done, the paste should have a thick, smooth consistency.Taste the batter once you have finished to make sure the blend of seasonings is to your liking. Add more salt and pepper if necessary, or a few pinches of cayenne pepper if you prefer spicier akara.You can leave the batter overnight if you want to make it lighter and more frothy. This step is optional, however."
4488,Make Akara,5,none,6,Heat 2-3 inches (5.08-7.62 cm) of vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat.,"To determine when the oil is ready, drop a small amount of batter into the pot. If it turns black instantly, the oil is too hot. If it sinks to the bottom of the pot with no reaction, the oil is too cool. If it sizzles but maintains its color, the oil is at an appropriate temperature.You can also use a digital thermometer for this step. If the thermometer reads 375 degrees Fahrenheit (190.5 Celsius), the oil is ready."
4489,Make Akara,6,none,7,Form the paste into balls about the size of ping-pong balls.,Use an ice cream scoop and your hands for this step. Make the balls in groups of however many your pot will hold at once. This way you can make them in batches.
4490,Make Akara,7,none,8,Drop the balls into the pot.,"Fry until golden brown, about 4 minutes total. Flip the balls halfway through. Once they are done, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon. Put them on a paper towel-lined plate to dry."

4497,Make Lilac Sugar,5,none,6,"After two to three days have passed, sift the sugar through a sieve with large holes.","Pull out the large petals as these should not be kept in the sugar for serving.   Add some of the violet food coloring at this stage if using. If you do so, leave the sugar on a parchment covered tray to dry out. This may take several days."
4498,Make Lilac Sugar,6,none,7,Store in an airtight container.,"Keep the lilac sugar in the pantry away from light and humidity. Use when making or baking foods that require a lilac flavour or add to your tea and coffee. It is also lovely sprinkled over cereal, fresh fruit and added to tisanes. Why not try making cinnamon toast using lilac sugar instead of plain sugar?"

4502,Make Cauliflower Rice,3,A,A4,Place the florets in the food processor.,"You can also use a blender if you don’t have a food processor.   If you have neither of these kitchen tools, you can try to grate up the cauliflower florets with a grater. But be prepared to use your arm muscles!"
4503,Make Cauliflower Rice,4,A,A5,Process the florets in batches.,"Set the food processor on low speed. Don’t overload the bowl of the processor or blender by pouring in all the cauliflower at once.The florets should be evenly chopped, but not pulverized. They should resemble grains of white rice."
4504,Make Cauliflower Rice,5,A,A6,Store the cauliflower rice or cook with it.,"If you’re processing a lot of cauliflower, store the “rice” in freezer safe sandwich bags. Make sure you remove the excess air in the bags before you seal them.Store the “rice” in the freezer for up to three months.When preparing frozen cauliflower rice, remove the bags from the freezer and leave them on the kitchen counter for a few minutes. This will soften and defrost the rice so it will be ready for cooking."
4505,Make Cauliflower Rice,6,B,B1,Heat two tablespoons of water or broth in a skillet.,Use medium high heat so the liquid is hot but not boiling.
4506,Make Cauliflower Rice,7,B,B2,Add the cauliflower rice.,Cover the skillet for about 2 minutes.
4509,Make Cauliflower Rice,10,C,C2,Spread the cauliflower rice on baking sheets.,"Make sure the “rice” is spread evenly in a single layer.   Don’t crowd the baking pan by stacking the cauliflower on top of each other, as this will make it steam and remain moist, instead of bake and dry out.Depending on how much “rice” you are preparing, you may need more than one baking sheet."

4513,Make Cauliflower Rice,14,D,D2,Add the cauliflower rice.,"This is called “dry frying”, without any added liquid like water or broth. This will help to remove as much moisture from the “rice” as possible.The cauliflower flavor will also mellow and become almost nutty, kind of like brown rice."
4514,Make Cauliflower Rice,15,D,D3,Season the “rice” with salt and pepper.,Keep an eye on the “rice” as it cooks. It should start to turn a nice golden brown color and soften.
4515,Make Cauliflower Rice,16,D,D4,Remove the “rice” from the heat and serve.,"Use the fried “rice” as side dish for other protein like meat, fish, or tofu.   You can also use fried cauliflower rice as a substitute for noodles in stir fries or for fried rice."

Turn on your stove and bring the water to a boil and then simmer the beans for 1.5 to 2 hours.          You can adjust the time you simmer your beans to adjust the tenderness of your beans. Shorter simmer times will yield firmer beans, longer times will result in more tender beans. While simmering, it's likely a foam will form on the top of your water. Add 1 - 2 tablespoons of butter or olive oil to the water to cut down on foam. Wait until the beans are completely cooked before adding any salt. Adding salt earlier interferes with the re-hydration process and can result in ""tough"" beans."
4652,Cook Navy Beans,4,none,5,Chop up your ingredients.,"Use a sharpened knife to cut a small onion, stalk of celery, several cloves of garlic, and tomatoes. These will be used to give flavor and variety in your simple navy bean dish. You can cut up these ingredients very finely to create a smoother consistency, or you could leave larger pieces for a chunkier end result.   Roma tomatoes or cherry tomatoes work well in this dish. Heirloom tomatoes can add a delicious, rich flavor to it."
4653,Cook Navy Beans,5,none,6,Mix in some pancetta or chopped bacon.,"All you need is a few slices for your dish, though if you're a fan of this kind of meat, you can always add more. If you're not a fan of pancetta or bacon, you could add chopped chicken or sausage.          Whatever meat you add, be sure you saute it until it is cooked throughout. Thicker, chunkier pieces of meat will require more time than thin pieces. Continue cooking your ingredients, lowering the heat if necessary, until the onions and bacon are well browned."
4654,Cook Navy Beans,6,none,7,"Saute the onion, celery, and garlic in olive oil.","Coat your saucepan with a thin layer of olive oil. Then turn on your stove top and set it to a medium-high heat. Add your onion, celery, and garlic to the pan and allow the ingredients to cook for 3 - 5 minutes.         If you notice your garlic start to brown, turn your heat down or begin the next phase of this dish. When cooked too long/burned, garlic can become bitter."
4655,Cook Navy Beans,7,none,8,Add your tomato(es).,"These will cook down in the heat of your pan. The tomato juice and flavor will also infuse through the rest of your dish. You can also create more nuanced flavors by adding spices and seasonings, like rosemary or thyme."
4656,Cook Navy Beans,8,none,9,Add the beans.,"By cooking your beans with your ingredients, the beans will take on the flavor of the dish. This will only take about a minute or so. After a minute has passed, if you want to further tenderize your beans, you should add enough water to cover the beans with at least an inch (2.5 cm) of water.You can add as many or as few beans as you desire to this dish."
4657,Cook Navy Beans,9,none,10,"Simmer the beans and other ingredients, if necessary.","If your beans are already cooked to your desired tenderness, you might not want to re-simmer the beans with the ingredients for very long. However, for further tenderness, you should first bring your ingredients to a boil. Then lower the heat until the mixture is at a simmer and allow it to simmer until the beans are tender.         During this process, you may need to add water to the mixture if you notice it getting too low."
4658,Cook Navy Beans,10,none,11,Garnish and serve your navy beans.,"When the beans are tender they are ready to serve. You may want to add some accents to the dish to improve its presentation. You can do this by topping it with some freshly chopped parsley, or even a sprig of parsley."

4690,Make Fried Oreos,0,none,1,Pour 2-3 inches (5-7.5cm) cooking oil in a heavy cooking pot.,"The pot should be deep enough so the sides are at least 4 inches (10cm) higher than the oil. When deep frying, there should be enough oil to completely cover the food you are frying, but the pot should not be more than half way full of oil.To fry, use a vegetable oil with a high smoking point and little to no flavor, like refined peanut oil, canola oil, grapeseed oil, or safflower oil.If you don't have a heavy cooking pot, or one with a very thick, heavy bottom, you can use a wok or a deep sauté pan instead.;"
4691,Make Fried Oreos,1,none,2,Heat the oil to 375ºF (191ºC).,"Use a frying, candy, or thermocouple thermometer. These thermometers show temperatures up to 500ºF (260°C).To check temperature of the oil, hold it in the center of the pan. If your thermometer clips to the side of the pan it will be easy to keep track of the temperature as you work.If you don't have a thermometer, stick a wooden spoon, skewer, or chopstick into the oil. If the oil bubbles around the wood, it's hot enough for frying.You can also use a kernel of popcorn to check the temperature. It will pop in oil that is 350ºF (178ºC), so you will know when it is close to optimum frying temperature.If the oil begins to smoke, it's too hot. Carefully removed your pan from the stove to cool."
4692,Make Fried Oreos,2,none,3,"Combine pancake mix, eggs, milk, and vegetable oil in a large bowl and whisk until smooth.","Your batter should not be runny--it should be thick and gooey so it will stick to the cookies.If your batter is too thin, add 1/4 cup of pancake mix.You can substitute funnel cake mix or waffle mix for pancake mix. Make sure it's thick enough to coat the Oreos."
4693,Make Fried Oreos,3,none,4,"Dip an Oreo in the pancake batter using tongs or your hands, coating it entirely with batter.The cookie shouldn't sit in batter too long or it will get soggy, so only dip one at a time and then put it straight in the oil.","The batter should be thick and sticky enough so you can't see through it to the chocolate cookie underneath.  If you hand-dip the cookies, just use one of your hands--then you can use your ""dry hand"" to start frying the cookies and you won't need to stop to wash. If the cookies are coming apart or crumbling, put them in the freezer for 30-60 minutes. This also prevents the cream center from getting too melted when you fry it."
4694,Make Fried Oreos,4,none,5,Put the coated Oreo in the hot oil.,"Frying works best in small batches, so fry only 4 or 5 at a time, depending on the size of your pot. The cookies should have enough room to float around without touching each other and sticking together.When adding cookies to the oil, the temperature will drop (especially if you froze the Oreos before hand). Keep the oil between 250ºF-325ºF (121ºC-163ºC) while frying.Attempting to fry large batches will not only cause your batter to stick together, it will also lower the temperature of the oil too low and the dough won't get crispy.Be careful when cooking with hot oil. Don't throw battered cookies into the pot--this would cause spattering, splashing, and a dangerous situation.If you're afraid to use your hand to place the cookies in the oil, use tongs instead."
4695,Make Fried Oreos,5,none,6,"Cook Oreos until they are crispy golden brown, remembering to turn them over with tongs.","The cookies will float on top of the oil and fry quickly--less than 2 minutes. Don't walk away from the pot or they may burn or over cook.Keep the cookies moving as they fry so they don't stick together. Allow the oil to heat up between batches, back to 375ºF (191ºC). Use tongs or a strainer to remove bits of batter that may be floating in the oil."
4696,Make Fried Oreos,6,none,7,Remove the fried cookies with tongs and place them on a paper towel to drain.,"Oil remains on the outer fried dough and won't reach the inside batter or cookie. Blotting excess grease will make this decadent treat slightly more healthy.The oil provides the flavor and crunch of the cookie, so don't go overboard and soak up every last drop.You can also drain the cookies on a wire rack, but using absorbent paper towel will remove more grease than letting it drip off on a wire rack."
4698,Make Fried Oreos,8,none,9,Serve warm.,"You can add a dusting of powdered sugar, vanilla ice cream, a drizzle of chocolate or caramel sauce, whipped cream, or any other garnish you'd like.   Allow the cookies a minute or two to cool so your don't burn yourself, but do eat them while they're still warm! Keep finished cookies in an oven on low heat (about 200ºF or 93ºC) if you're doing a large batch so they will stay warm until they are served."
4699,Cook Red Snapper,0,A,A1,Pick out a whole fish.,"There are many varieties of snapper, but red snapper has distinctive bright red metallic skin that fades into pink near the belly. When you're picking out a whole snapper, look for eyes that are clear and red. The flesh should be firm to the touch.   Snapper has become so ubiquitous that it's often used as a catchall term for any kind of white fish. For this reason it's commonly mislabeled as a similar but less desirable fish, like rock cod. When you buy snapper, be sure to do so from a trusted fishmonger so you'll know you're buying the real thing.Ask for the fish to be gutted and cleaned, unless you want to do so yourself. You’ll need about ¾ of whole snapper per serving.;"
4701,Cook Red Snapper,2,A,A3,Prep a baking pan.,"Choose a metal, glass or ceramic baking pan or dish that's just large enough to hold the fish. Line the pan with aluminum foil to prevent the fish from sticking."
4702,Cook Red Snapper,3,A,A4,Season the fish.,"Red snapper is delicious with light seasonings that complement its fresh flavor. Sprinkle salt, pepper and lemon juice to taste inside the fish’s cavity. Add pieces of butter inside the fish to keep it moist while it bakes. Season the outside with more salt and pepper.   If you want the dish to have an herbal taste, add sprigs of thyme, rosemary or basil inside the fish's cavity. For a complete meal, place sliced carrots, onions or potatoes around the fish in the baking dish. The vegetables will cook along with the fish."
4703,Cook Red Snapper,4,A,A5,Bake the fish.,"Place the baking dish in the oven and cook the fish for 45 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. It can be a little tricky to tell whether the fish is ready, but you know it's done with the flesh is no longer translucent.   After 40 minutes or so, check the fish to see if it's done. You can gently pull back some flesh with a fork. If it looks white and easily flakes off, it's ready. If it's still a little rubbery, it needs more time. Return it to the oven if it needs more time, then check again in five or ten minutes."
4704,Cook Red Snapper,5,A,A6,Transfer the fish to a platter and serve.Whole red snapper looks impressive on a platter surrounded by fresh herb sprigs.,"To serve, use a serving fork or spoon to heap fish on individual plates."
4705,Cook Red Snapper,6,B,B1,Choose fresh red snapper fillets.,"Red snapper fillets should be purchased with the skin on, since it yields a delicious flavor and helps keep the fish together while it cooks. Look for fillets with metallic pink skin and firm flesh. You will need 1/4 to 1/3 pound per serving size."
4706,Cook Red Snapper,7,B,B2,Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.,"This high cooking temperature helps the fillets roast quickly so they have a flaky, moist texture."
4707,Cook Red Snapper,8,B,B3,Line a rimmed baking sheet with lemon slices.,Baking the fillets on top of lemon slices helps them retain moisture. First lightly oil a baking sheet that has a rim. Slice a lemon into thin discs and lay them out on the baking sheet.
4708,Cook Red Snapper,9,B,B4,Place a fillet on top of each pair of slices.,"One fillet should fit neatly over two slices, but if you're roasting large fillets, you might need three. Position each fillet skin side down."
4709,Cook Red Snapper,10,B,B5,Season the fillets.,"Sprinkle the top of the fillets with salt and pepper. You can also add a little cayenne, garlic powder, thyme, or any other herb to taste."
4710,Cook Red Snapper,11,B,B6,Bake the fillets.,"Place the baking sheet in the oven once the oven is completely preheated. Bake the snapper fillets for about 15 minutes, or until they are no longer translucent. When they're done, the flesh should be opaque and it should flake easily when poked with a fork."
4711,Cook Red Snapper,12,B,B7,Make a sauce.,"Red snapper fillets can be dressed up with a simple butter sauce that brings out the best in their flavor. The sauce is quite easy to make, and it will take the dish up a notch. While the fish is baking, melt together the following ingredients in a saucepan:   2 tablespoons butter ¼ teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon chopped rosemary Salt and pepper to taste A teaspoon of lemon zest"
4712,Cook Red Snapper,13,B,B8,Serve the filets with the herbed butter.,Place each fillet on a plate atop two lemon sliced. Pour a little melted butter over each fillet.
4713,Cook Red Snapper,14,C,C1,Buy fresh red snapper fillets.,"Pick out fillets with the skin on, since it becomes deliciously crispy when you sauté fillets. Buy fillets with metallic pink skin and firm flesh. You will need 1/4 to 1/3 pound per serving size."
4714,Cook Red Snapper,15,C,C2,Season the fillets with salt and pepper.,"Pat the fillets with a paper towel to make sure they're completely dry, then sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper."
4715,Cook Red Snapper,16,C,C3,Heat olive oil over medium heat.,"Heat the oil until it's hot, but not smoking."
4716,Cook Red Snapper,17,C,C4,Add the fillets skin side down.,"When the oil is hot, slip them into the pan. Cook them until the skin is golden brown, about three minutes. Monitor the heat while they cook to make sure the skin isn't getting burned. If it turns brown right away, reduce the heat."
4717,Cook Red Snapper,18,C,C5,Flip the fillets and finish cooking them.,The fillets should cook on the other side for about three more minutes. The fish is done when it’s no longer translucent and flakes easily when poked with a fork.
4718,Cook Red Snapper,19,C,C6,Serve the fillets.,They're excellent with melted butter and lemon juice.
4719,Cook Red Snapper,20,D,D1,Use skinless fillets.,"You may not be able to find skinless red snapper, but you can remove the skin once you get it home. The fillets will fry more evenly without the skin. Slice the fillets into finger-sized pieces to help them cook more quickly and evenly."
4720,Cook Red Snapper,21,D,D2,Prepare the batter.,"Red snapper is so versatile that it tastes great with any type of breading or batter. You can use a classic dry seafood breading, Japanese Panko breading, or a beer batter.   To make a dry breading, mix 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup dry bread crumbs and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Add black and red pepper to taste. Panko is a popular choice as well. This breading is sold in canisters available in the breading aisle in the grocery store. If you like the taste of beer batter, mix 2 cups flour and one 12-ounce beer. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt and black pepper to taste."
4721,Cook Red Snapper,22,D,D3,Heat the oil.,"Pour enough oil into a stockpot to rise up the sides by two inches. Heat it over medium high heat until it reaches 365 degrees. Check the temperature with a kitchen thermometer before you proceed, since the fish won't fry correctly if the oil isn't hot enough.   Use an oil with a high smoke point, such as canola oil or peanut oil. Olive oil and other low smoke point oils will break down when they're heated to a high temperature."
4722,Cook Red Snapper,23,D,D4,Dredge the fillets in the batter.,Be sure each piece is well coated on all sides. Try placing the fillets and batter together in a bag and shaking it to coat the fillets evenly.
4723,Cook Red Snapper,24,D,D5,Fry the fillets.,"Place them in the oil a few at a time. Fry them for one or two minutes, or until the pieces float. Don’t crowd the pan or they won’t cook properly. The fish will fry very quickly, so monitor the pieces carefully to ensure they don't burn."
4724,Cook Red Snapper,25,D,D6,Remove the fillets and drain them on a paper towel.,Use a slotted spoon to transfer them from the pot to a towel-lined plate. The fried fish pieces are excellent when served with lemon wedges and tartar sauce.

4744,Make Mashed Cauliflower,0,A,A1,Place the cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl.,"Add 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water to the bowl and cover the dish with microwave-safe plastic wrap.Instead of using a microwave-safe bowl, you could also use a microwave-safe glass casserole dish that already has a lid. Do not use plastic wrap if you are using a lid. Avoid lids that create an air-proof seal. If the lid to your dish creates a tight seal, leave the lid slightly askew on the top of the container to allow the contents of the dish room to vent.;"
4745,Make Mashed Cauliflower,1,A,A2,Microwave for 3 to 5 minutes.,"Cook the cauliflower on full power in the microwave until it becomes tender.   Once ready, the cauliflower should be tender enough to easily pierce with a fork.

4746,Make Mashed Cauliflower,2,A,A3,Let stand.,"Before you mash the cauliflower, let it cool down for about 5 minutes, or until it feels cool enough to touch.Drain any excess water from the dish before proceeding. The cauliflower needs to be fairly dry."
4747,Make Mashed Cauliflower,3,A,A4,Transfer the cauliflower to a food processor along with the other ingredients.,"Add the chicken broth, sour cream, salt, and pepper. If the cauliflower is too large to fit into the food processor, cut it into chunks using a kitchen knife.   You could use a blender if you do not have a food processor. Note that the cauliflower will need “steam” room, though, so if you use a blender, cover the top of the blender with a heavy, clean kitchen towel."
4748,Make Mashed Cauliflower,4,A,A5,Pulse until smooth.,"Blend the ingredients together until you get the texture you desire. Scrape the sides with a spatula, as needed, to ensure even blending.   For creamier mashed cauliflower, blend the ingredients together at a high speed for a few minutes. For chunkier mashed cauliflower, pulse the ingredients together at a medium speed for only a minute or so."
4750,Make Mashed Cauliflower,6,B,B1,Boil a large saucepan of water.,"Fill a large saucepan or stockpot roughly halfway with water and heat it over high heat. Once it reaches a boil, add a dash of salt to the water.   Adding salt to the water allows the salt the flavor the cauliflower as it cooks. You could add it before the water reaches a boil, but doing so will cause the water to take a little more time to reach its boiling point."

If your stockpot is large enough, you do not need to transfer the cauliflower to another bowl. It can be mashed directly inside the pot."
4756,Make Mashed Cauliflower,12,B,B7,Mash the cauliflower with a potato masher.,Use this utensil to smash the soft cauliflower until it reaches a chunky consistency reminiscent of mashed potatoes. Make sure that the other ingredients are worked into the cauliflower as you mash it.   Use firm pressure and press the potato masher straight down into the contents of the pot.
4758,Make Mashed Cauliflower,14,C,C1,Boil water in a large saucepan.,"Fill a large saucepan or stockpot about 1/2 to 2/3 full with water. Heat the water on high until it reaches a boil. Add a dash of salt to the water, if desired.   Adding salt to the water will draw out more flavor from the cauliflower. You could add it before the water reaches a boil, but doing so will cause the water to take a little more time to reach its boiling point. As a result, you may find it more beneficial to add it after the water has already begun boiling."
4759,Make Mashed Cauliflower,15,C,C2,Add the cauliflower and cook for 8 to 10 minutes.,"Cook the cauliflower, uncovered, until it becomes tender.   The cauliflower must be tender enough to pierce with a fork."
4760,Make Mashed Cauliflower,16,C,C3,Drain the water.,"Once the cauliflower is adequately cooked, pour the contents of the stockpot or saucepan through a colander to separate the water from the vegetable.   Throw the drained cauliflower back into the still-hot saucepan. Let it sit, removed from the heat of the stove, with the lid on for 2 to 3 minutes."
4761,Make Mashed Cauliflower,17,C,C4,"Combine and heat the garlic, coconut oil, coconut milk, salt, and pepper.","Place the ingredients in a microwave-safe bowl and heat, uncovered, for about 1 minute on full power.If you are concerned about food splatters, lightly cover the top of the bowl with a paper towel before you microwave the coconut milk mixture. Doing so will prevent most splatters without interfering with the heating process. Note that you could also heat these ingredients in a small saucepan on the stove for the same amount of time."
4762,Make Mashed Cauliflower,18,C,C5,Puree the cauliflower in a food processor.,"Meanwhile, transfer the cooked cauliflower to a food processor and puree on medium to high speed until whipped and smooth.   As you process the cauliflower, you may need to scrap down the sides of the food processor with a spatula periodically to ensure even blending. You could use a blender instead of a food processor, if necessary."
4763,Make Mashed Cauliflower,19,C,C6,Add the coconut milk solution and pulse.,"Once the cauliflower reaches your desired consistency, add the warm coconut milk mixture to the mashed cauliflower and pulse for 10 seconds.   The coconut milk mixture will make the cauliflower creamier, but it must be evenly blended into the cauliflower."
4764,Make Mashed Cauliflower,20,C,C7,Serve warm.,"Mashed cauliflower is best enjoyed while still warm. Top with butter, additional pepper, or chives, as desired."

4782,Prepare Crab Stuffed Salmon,1,none,2,Assemble the crab stuffing.,Dump your crab meat into a large bowl. Sauté a small onion and half of a bell pepper in butter on the stove until the vegetables are tender. Place these into the bowl. Whisk 1 egg in a separate bowl. Add mustard and whip to combine it with the egg. Add this to the crab meat bowl. Grate approximately 4 tbsp (56.7 g) of frozen Brie into the bowl. Toss in 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) (14.3 g) of pine nuts. Set the stuffing mixture into the refrigerator until the salmon is ready.
4783,Prepare Crab Stuffed Salmon,2,none,3,Create a stuffing cavity in the salmon.,Place the steaks on a cutting board. Insert a sharp knife into one side of the salmon steak. Stop when you are about two-thirds of the way inside. Cut away a small square of salmon by gently running the knife along the interior. The size of the square you should cut depends on the amount of crab you want in each steak.

Set each steak onto the baking sheet with the skin side facing upward. Bake the salmon for 8 to 10 minutes, depending on the thickness of the steaks. The meat is done when the steaks have turned an opaque pink hue. Flip the salmon and grate the rest of the Brie on top. Place in the broiler until the cheese browns, about 4 minutes."
4788,Deep Fry a Turkey,0,none,1,Season the turkey.,"Begin by sprinkling cayenne pepper over the top of the turkey and around the legs, rubbing it in as you go. Then turn it on its side, sprinkle more cayenne and rub it in. Completely turn the turkey over upside down before sprinkling and rubbing the underside. Continue until the entire body has been well covered and rubbed.          There are many different ways to season the turkey, so feel free to look up recipes. Most of them involve rubbing the turkey with seasoning or injecting it with marinade. Try to get the rub under the skin as the skin is often tossed on a big bird once it gets overcooked.;"
4789,Deep Fry a Turkey,1,none,2,Make the metal handle.,"This method is recommended if you do not have a deep frying basket. Place the turkey on its shoulders (where the head would be) and begin to spear the wire through it, just underneath the breast and by the wings. Carefully pull the wire through and loop the wire around about three times to make a metal handle. Twist the ends of the wire around your handle so there are no sharp ends.          It is very important to do a little test to make sure that your handle is totally secure when lifting up the turkey. Only when you are convinced that the handle is strong enough should you move onto the next step. To get the oil to the hard to reach spots, make incision in the leg skin where it pulls against the body to allow the oil better access."
4790,Deep Fry a Turkey,2,none,3,Prepare the burner.,"The frying of the turkey must be done outside, in a dry and well ventilated area and not near anything flammable. Set the gas burner on a level surface because this is one of the safest options to ensure that the fryer doesn't tip over. Keep the propane tank as far away from the fryer as possible and make sure it is not on, under or near any flammable materials. When not set up properly, a deep fryer can explode. Read the instructions that came with your fryer.          Never use the fryer in the garage or on the deck when oil is in the pot."
4791,Deep Fry a Turkey,3,none,4,Prepare the oil level.,"Fill the pot halfway with water. Then roughly half fill the bucket with water, which should represent the same weight as your turkey. Place the bucket into the pot to make sure the water does not go past the top of the bucket; it should be at least 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) below the rim. If it is too high, then discard some of the water. The water line will represent the quantity of oil you will need, so make a note of it. Remove the bucket and tip away the water from the pot.          Alternatively, you can put the turkey itself in the empty pot and add enough water to just cover (1-2 inches above) the turkey. Again, the level should be at least 5 or 6 inches (12.7 or 15.2 cm) below the rim. Take the turkey out and measure the depth of the water with a ruler. Dry the turkey thoroughly afterward."
4792,Deep Fry a Turkey,4,none,5,Dry the pot.,It is extremely important to thoroughly wipe the pot dry with some kitchen roll. You must not leave any water in the pot as hot oil and water can be a very dangerous combination.
4793,Deep Fry a Turkey,5,none,6,Add the oil.,"Pour the oil into the pot to the level where the water was. You should have somewhere between 3–5 inches (7.6–12.7 cm) of oil in the pot. Light your gas burner and adjust to a high setting, then place the pot carefully down onto the burner plate. Place the thermometer into the oil and allow the oil to heat to a temperature of 350 °F (175 °C). The time it takes to heat to cooking temperatures varies.          You should monitor the temperature throughout the heating and cooking process. Depending on your burner and outside conditions, the oil can heat up to dangerous levels very quickly. Put on a protective jacket/apron and gloves. You may also wish to put on safety goggles to keep oil from splashing in your eyes."
4794,Deep Fry a Turkey,6,none,7,Check the temperature.,"Once the oil has reached 350 °F (175 °C), you're ready to fry. Make sure you have on your protective gloves and jacket when handling the turkey or working around the hot oil. With the metal hook attached to the wire loop handle of your turkey, lower the turkey with extreme care into the hot oil. Even with the bird patted dry, there will be a violent reaction when it hits the hot oil. Do this very slowly and be aware of any hot splashing oil.          It is strongly recommended to turn off the burner while the turkey is being submerged, then to turn it back on once the turkey is in. Boiled over oil hitting the burner is the cause of most accidents. For a large bird, use a pole of some sort like a hockey stick. Put it through the handle and have someone help lower the bird into the pot. This will help keep your distance from the oil as it reacts to the bird."
4795,Deep Fry a Turkey,7,none,8,Fry the turkey.,"Allow 3-4 minutes of cooking for every 500 grams (17.6 oz) (1lb). Monitor the temperature by leaving a candy thermometer in the oil (hung from a copper wire) as the turkey cooks. Never leave the hot oil unattended during the cooking process! When the bird is dropped and the fluids begin to cook out, the boiling off of these fluids tends to cool the oil, after which the oil temperature may tend to rise. Halfway through the cooking process, check to see how the turkey is doing by briefly lifting it out of the pot, again using the metal hook attached to the wire handle. Then lower it back into the pot for the rest of the cooking period.   Cooking time can vary based on factors such as outdoor temperature and the temperature of the bird. If the oil begins to smoke at any time, lower the heat. Overheated oil can lead to combustion. To control the temperature if it starts to rise, adjust the burner to turn down the heat."
4796,Deep Fry a Turkey,8,none,9,Finish the frying.,"Once the turkey begins to float to the top of the oil, allow it cook for an additional 15 minutes. Once cooked, carefully remove your turkey from the pot, give it a little shake to disperse the excess oil and transfer it back onto its platter. Check the internal temperature with the meat thermometer. The temperature should be at least 165 degrees F (75 degrees C), but preferably 170 degrees F (77 degrees C) in the breast and 180 degrees F (82 degrees C) in the thigh. Turn off the flame. Let the oil cool completely, making sure it's in a spot where nobody (especially kids and pets) will run into it. Remove the wire and serve."
4797,Cook Ramps,0,A,A1,Trim and wash the ramps.,"For the sauteed ramps, you’ll need ½ pound (227 g) of ramps. To prepare them for cooking, use a sharp knife to cut off the roots. Next, run the ramps under cool water at the sink to remove any dirt or debris.To ensure that the ramps are dry, it’s a good idea to place them in a colander or sieve after you rinse them. Shake them well to remove any excess moisture.;"
4798,Cook Ramps,1,A,A2,Separate the bulbs and the leaves.,"When the ramps are trimmed and cleaned, use the knife to separate the white bulbs from the green leaves. Leave the bulbs in tact, but cut the leaves in half or thirds horizontally.If any of the leaves appear tough or overly large, discard them. They are usually too chewy even after sauteing. If you notice any translucent skins, which are similar to those that you find on green onions or scallions, peel them away and discard."
4799,Cook Ramps,2,A,A3,Heat the oil.,"Place a nonstick skillet on the stove over medium-high heat. Add 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of extra virgin olive oil, and allow it to heat until it begins to shimmer, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.If you prefer, you can substitute butter for the olive oil."
4800,Cook Ramps,3,A,A4,Add the white bulbs and cook them until translucent.,"When the oil is hot, add the white bulbs to the skillet. Allow them to cook for 2 minutes, or until they become translucent.Be sure to stir the bulbs occasionally to ensure that they cook evenly."
4801,Cook Ramps,4,A,A5,Mix in the leaves and saute the mixture for another couple of minutes.,"Once the bulbs are translucent, add the ramp leaves to the skillet. Let them cook with the bulbs for another 2 minutes, or until the leaves begin to wilt.As with the bulbs, stir the leaves periodically as you saute them to ensure that they cook evenly."
4802,Cook Ramps,5,A,A6,Season the ramps with salt and pepper and serve.,"When the ramp bulbs and leaves are finished cooking, stir in some salt and pepper to taste to season them. Place them in a serving bowl, and serve as a side with your favorite main course.If you prefer, you can add other seasonings to the ramp, such as chili powder or cumin. The sauteed ramps also make a delicious topping for sandwiches and pizza."
4805,Cook Ramps,8,B,B3,Bake the ramps until the leaves begin to char.,"Once the ramps are seasoned and coated with olive oil, place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Allow the ramps to roast for 15 to 17 minutes, or until the leaves just begin to char.You don’t want the ramps to actually burn. They’ll have a burnt toast taste if they do."
4806,Cook Ramps,9,B,B4,"Add the ramps to a salad, pasta dish, or sandwiches.","When the ramps are finished roasting, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Mix the ramps into salads and pasta dishes, or use them as a topping for steaks and burgers.Store leftover roasted ramps in an airtight container in the refrigerator. They should stay fresh for up to three days."
4807,Cook Ramps,10,C,C1,"Toss the ramps with olive oil, salt, and pepper.","Place 32 ramps that have been cleaned and trimmed on a large, rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of extra virgin olive oil over them, and season them with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Toss the mixture well so the ramps are well coated.You can season the ramps with any other spices that you like, such as cumin or crushed red pepper."
4809,Cook Ramps,12,C,C3,Cook the ramps on the grill until they’re tender.,"When the grill is preheated, use tongs to place the ramps on the heated side of the grate. Let them cook until they become tender and slightly charred along the edges, which should take approximately 2 minutes.Be sure to turn the ramps occasionally as you grill them to ensure that they cook evenly."
4811,Cook Ramps,14,D,D1,Bring a pot of salted water to boil.,"Fill a large pot approximately ⅔’s full with water. Season the water with salt, and place it on the stove on high heat. Allow the water to come to a full boil.You should add enough salt to the water so it tastes like sea water."
4812,Cook Ramps,15,D,D2,Add the ramp leaves and boil quickly.,"For the pesto, you’ll need the leaves from 2 dozen ramps. When the water has come to a boil, add them to the pot and allow them to boil for 1 minute."
4813,Cook Ramps,16,D,D3,Transfer the leaves to cold water.,"Once the ramp leaves have boiled for a minute, remove them from the pot with a slotted spoon. Immediately dump them into a boil of ice water to stop the cooking process. Let the leaves sit in the water until they are cooled. Make sure to set up the bowl of ice water beside the stove before you begin boiling the ramp leaves, so you can transfer them to it right after boiling."
4815,Cook Ramps,18,D,D5,Chop the ramp leaves.,"After you’ve dried the ramp leaves, use a sharp knife to chop them. They don’t need to be finely chopped, though, because they’ll be shredded further in the food processor."
4816,Cook Ramps,19,D,D6,Pulse the pine nuts and garlic in a food processor.,"To begin the pesto, add 3 roughly chopped garlic cloves and ¼ cup (35 g) of toasted pine nuts to the bowl of a food processor. Pulse the mixture until the ingredients are finely crushed.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender or mortar and pestle to make the pesto."
4817,Cook Ramps,20,D,D7,Mix in the cheese and ramps.,"Once the garlic and nuts are crushed, add 3 tablespoons (15 g) of grated pecorino romano cheese and the chopped ramp leaves to food processor. Pulse the mixture until the leaves are fully chopped and the mixture is completely blended.You can substitute parmesan or asiago cheese for the pecorino romano."
4818,Cook Ramps,21,D,D8,Add the oil a tablespoon at a time until the pesto reaches the proper consistency.,"When the nuts, garlic, cheese, and ramp leaves are combined, start streaming up to ½ cup (118 g) of extra-virgin olive oil into the mixture as you pulse the food processor. Continue mixing the pesto until it reaches your desired consistency.The proper amount of oil depends on the consistency you want for the pesto. If you plan to use it as a spread, add less oil. If you are using it as a sauce, add more oil."

5022,Make Pho,0,none,1,Collect beef bones.,"Although your pho will get a lot of its flavour from the ingredients you throw into it while cooking, it's a good idea to rely on beef bones for the majority. A lot of beef flavour sinks into bone marrow, making bones a perfect tool for creating hearty broths. It's recommended you fill up a pot with water and put in the bones as early as you can. A broth needs at least 6 hours simmering to complete, and you'll want to replace the bones with meat ingredients at an earlier stage.   On the other hand, you can buy a storebought beef stock for the purpose of your broth. It won't have the same hearty, homemade quality to it, but you'll be able to make the soup in a fraction of the time.;"
5023,Make Pho,1,none,2,Gather your beef parts.,"One of the things that turns off some Western diners to pho is the variety of different beef types in the soup. Ingredients like tendon and bone marrow may seem like weird addition, but they soak in the broth flavour very well and can be recommended as a result. Beef is the standard meat used in pho. Standard rare beef chunks are fine, but the less common pieces can typically be purchased at a butcher's shop.Beef chuck is a common purchase for pho, with lots of fat to go in the soup. Brisket is a flavourful and lighter alternative to chuck. Oxtail and cow shin are great for pho. The bone marrow has lots of gelatin and combines with the broth well. Gelatin is incredibly nutritious and will add to the feeling of warmth you get after eating pho. Beef flank is a lean type of beef. Because it doesn't taste as good once it's been simmered for a long time, it's recommended you place rare thin strips of it in once the dish is finally being served. Chicken isn't recommended as part of a pho soup. It doesn't cook as well in the broth. However, versions of pho do exist with chicken and even pork, so if it sounds like something you might prefer, you should give it a try."
5024,Make Pho,2,none,3,Cut your meat into pieces.,"If you're buying pieces of meat directly from a butcher's store, you may need to cut the beef into chunks for the pho. The chunks should be roughly bite-sized. If you have any doubts, try placing them on a spoon to see whether you need to cut them any further. You can add as much or as little   The pieces should be smaller rather than larger in order to ensure they're properly cooked within the broth."
5025,Make Pho,3,none,4,Cook your beef.,"Cooking beef before adding it to the broth is actually optional. Although it's necessary if you're using a premade beef stock, the beef will cook when it's simmering in the broth. If you're trying to make pho in a faster time, it's a good idea to fry up your meat. Cook it until the meat is pink. Don't cook the meat beyond rareness. If you do, you'll lose the potential for tenderness that many people find so appealing about pho.   Cook the beef in a pan on high heat. Add some canola oil to the pan and let it heat for 30 seconds before you add the beef onto the pan. Let the beef cook on both sides by turning it over. Try to get both sides of each piece cooked evenly. Though you can cook it however you'd like, it's recommended to leave the beef rare. The rest of it can be cooked in the pho broth itself. In order for the beef to cook naturally in the soup, you should set at least 6 hours aside. If there's any doubt, it's probably a better idea to cook your meat to rareness."
5026,Make Pho,4,none,5,Simmer a pot of water in beef bones.,"Beef bones are where you'll get the distinctive broth taste. It's recommended that you let the broth simmer for 3 hours with the beef bones in the soup. From there, the bones should have left their flavour in the broth, and you can replace the bones with the edible beef ingredients.   Add salt to your pot to get a more striking taste."
5027,Make Pho,5,none,6,Replace the beef bones with the beef ingredients.,"Your beef parts should be added three hours after you first put the bones in the broth. From there, the soup should be left to simmer for an additional 3 hours. It's recommended you take out the bones before adding the rest as it can be difficult to extract the bones once the pot is filled."
5028,Make Pho,6,none,7,Throw charred onions and ginger into the mix.Onions and ginger help to give the pho that pleasant smokiness.,"Charred onions have the best effect. Take a pair of tongs and use them to hold onions over a gas-powered stove. From there, chop them up into thin slices and add them to the pho. You will definitely notice the improvement to your broth.   Depending on how much you want the charred onions to inform the broth's taste, you can either add them early on with the beef ingredients, or you can serve it after adding the noodles as a garnish. For the sake of smokiness, it's recommended you add them with the beef."
5029,Make Pho,7,none,8,Boil rice noodles.,"In a separate saucepan, bring water to a boil. From there, take a handful of rice noodles and throw them in. Depending on the thickness of the noodles you're using, it can take up to five minutes for the noodles to properly cook.Once the noodles are sufficiently soft, strain them out of the second saucepan and add them to your main pho pot.   To preserve their form, it's recommended you try blanching the noodles, taking them quickly from boiling to cold water as a way to quickly halt the cooking process. Let the dry noodles into a boil for 10-20 seconds until they have lost their stiffness, then immediately put them under cold water. This will ensure they are cooked properly, but will stop the cooking before they get soggy."
5030,Make Pho,8,none,9,Add vegetables.,"If you're making your own pho, you can practically add whatever vegetables you like into the broth. Because vegetables tamper with the broth's flavour, they should be steamed and added to the broth after it's finished cooking.Carrots and broccoli are most recommended, as they're spoon-sized and compliment the taste of the broth.Carrots are best cut into coin-thin slices so that they best soak up the flavour of the soup.   Get the vegetables to a soft tenderness before adding. They will get softer still once added to the hot broth. The texture shouldn't be resistant to the teeth at all, but the vegetables should retain enough strength to keep their form."
5031,Make Pho,9,none,10,Top with spices.A great cook always tries to make his dish great on the eyes as much as the taste buds.,"Aromatic spices help improve the taste of the pho, but they're also great for adding that visual touch once the basics have been taken care of. Sprinkle cilantro and green onion atop your soup once the broth and main ingredients are ready for eating.   Prepackaged pho spice blends are available, but they aren't recommended if you want the best-tasting pho."
5032,Make Pho,10,none,11,Serve with bean sprouts and lime wedges.The constant friend of pho has always been bean sprouts.,"Bean sprouts are a light and tasty thing to eat alongside your main course. Although you should serve them on a separate plate, the sprouts can be added to the broth once your meat and noodles begin to run out. Lime wedges are a nice touch as well, whether for adding tang to the broth or for fitting in a beverage.   Storebought bean sprouts go bad within a couple of days, so it's a good idea to eat them shortly after they're purchased."
5033,Make Pho,11,none,12,Include sriracha and hoisin sauce.,"Most pho restaurants include a few spicy sauces to sweeten the deal. Whether you want to add these to the broth as you're making it or keep them at hand when you eat it is your decision. Generally speaking, these sauces are great to have when it comes time to eat. Rather than adding them from the start, you should keep them handy to calibrate the taste to your liking.   Don't rely on spicy sauces to mask a weak broth. A top-notch pho won't need any sriracha to be delicious."
5035,Make Pho,13,none,14,Customize your recipe in the future.,"The great thing about pho is that you can customize it to your liking once you have the basic broth and noodles ready.Pho isn't a hard meal to make once you have the ingredients and process down, so it makes sense to play around with the recipe. Do you like extra beef or spice? Make it happen. A big part of the enjoyment in home cooking is the freedom to choose and experiment.   If you've been to many pho restaurants before, you'll know a big thing about pho recipes are the portions and kinds of meat they use in the broth. Simply changing up the portions of one meat in exchange for another can change the experience of the meal."

5049,Cook Oxtails,1,A,A2,Cover the ingredients with liquid.,"Pour enough beef broth and red wine into the stockpot to cover the ingredients.   Start with the beef broth and make up the difference with the red wine. If you still do not have enough liquid to cover the ingredients, add a little water or additional broth."
5050,Cook Oxtails,2,A,A3,Stew the oxtails for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.Bring the liquid to a boil over medium-high to high heat.,"After it begins to boil, stir it, cover the pot, and reduce the heat to medium. Let it simmer for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.   Stir the oxtails every 15 to 30 minutes to ensure even cooking. If the liquid is still boiling rapidly after dropping the heat, you may need to drop the heat to medium-low. The oxtails should cook in simmering liquid, not rapidly boiling liquid. Remove the pot from the heat after the designated amount of time has passed."
5051,Cook Oxtails,3,A,A4,Warm the olive oil and flour in a skillet over medium heat.,"Heat the oil first for 30 to 60 seconds before adding the flour. Stir continuously for 3 minutes.   Vegetable oil, bacon drippings, or shortening can also be used instead of olive oil."
5052,Cook Oxtails,4,A,A5,Remove 4 cups (1 l) of liquid from the stock pot.,"Add this liquid to the skillet and stir continuously until a thick gravy forms.   You can also add a few dashes of browning sauce to the gravy to deepen the color. The gravy can be flavored with additional salt, pepper, and garlic powder, if desired. Remove the skillet from the heat."
5053,Cook Oxtails,5,A,A6,Coat the oxtails in the gravy.,"Transfer the oxtails from the stock pot to the skillet, coating them with the gravy by stirring them in. Heat over medium-low for 5 minutes."

5056,Cook Oxtails,8,B,B2,Rinse the salt off.,"Use running water and scrub the salt off with your fingers.   You need to remove virtually all salt from the meat. Otherwise, you will end up with an excruciatingly salty dish by the end."

5060,Cook Oxtails,12,B,B6,Add the liquids and seasonings to the pot.,"Fill the pot with the beef broth and Balsamic vinegar. Use enough red wine to cover the top of the meat by 1 inch (2.5 cm). Mix in the rosemary, thyme, oregano, and tarragon."
5064,Cook Oxtails,16,C,C1,Heat the oil in a skillet.,"Use medium-high heat.   Vegetable oil, bacon grease, or shortening may also be used instead of olive oil."
5065,Cook Oxtails,17,C,C2,Season and brown the oxtails.,"Sprinkle the oxtails with enough salt to season them and coat the slices in flour. Add them to the skillet and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until evenly browned on all sides.   This step could be skipped, but browning the meat beforehand adds a significant amount of flavor to the final dish.Coating the oxtails in flour leads to better browning."
5066,Cook Oxtails,18,C,C3,Transfer the oxtails and other ingredients to the slow cooker.,"Place the oxtails in the slow cooker. Cover with Balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary, oregano, thyme, and onion. Pour in the broth and add enough red wine to cover the meat by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).   To make cleaning up easier, you could spray the inside of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. You could also use a nonstick slow cooker liner."
5067,Cook Oxtails,19,C,C4,Cover and cook on low heat for 8 hours.,"You could also cook the oxtails for 3 to 4 hours on high.   Do not stir the contents of the slow cooker or open the lid as it cooks. Doing so could release a significant amount of heat, and you may need to add an additional 30 minutes onto the cooking time simply by opening it for a few minutes."
5068,Cook Oxtails,20,C,C5,Serve warm.,Turn off the heat and transfer the oxtails to a serving platter. Let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.

5104,Make Eggs in a Basket,0,A,A1,Cut a hole in the bread.,"In the middle of the bread, cut a hole with approximately a 2-inch diameter. An alternate way to prepare the bread is to cut a square into the bread with a knife.   Choose any bread you like. White, wheat, sourdough, baguette, rye - anything you'd like will make a tasty dish. You can make a hole with a glass, a jar, or the top to cooking spray. Press the item into the bread and the hole should be easily removed. To make a treat for the kids, you can also use fun-shaped cookie cutters to cut out the shape in the middle. Suggest that they use the remaining cut-out piece to dip in the yolk. For a romantic breakfast, use a heart-shaped cookie cutter to cut out the center. If you don't have a cookie cutter, try cutting a heart with a knife.;"
5105,Make Eggs in a Basket,1,A,A2,Fry the bread.,"Add butter to the frying pan. While the butter is melting in the pan, spread more butter on both sides of the bread. Place the bread in the pan. Fry the bread on medium until it begins to brown.Flip the bread over. Allow this bread to cook until it is a golden brown.   You can butter the removed ""hole"" and fry it along with the egg for an added treat. Many people dip this bread into the yolk. You can also use vegetable, coconut, or grapeseed oil instead of butter."
5106,Make Eggs in a Basket,2,A,A3,Add the egg.,"Before placing the egg in the hole, add more butter to the pan in the open hole of the bread. Crack the egg open and drop the egg into the hole.   If you would like less whites in the dish, separate the egg whites from the yolks. Place the yolk in the hole and add a small amount of whites. This will cause the egg to cook faster.Add ham or bacon to the egg, place a piece of cheese on top of the bread, or you can add spices, such as salt, pepper, or paprika for a slight variation."
5107,Make Eggs in a Basket,3,A,A4,Fry the egg.,"Let the egg cook for an additional minute or two. Then, carefully flip the bread to fry the other side. Make sure the egg whites are fully cooked. The whites should not be runny or jiggly.Before you flip the bread and egg, lift the edge of the bread up with a spatula. Make sure the egg has solidified and started to brown before you flip it over.The egg will start to set into the bread when it is done. If you like runnier eggs, cook for less time. If you like harder yolks, cook for longer.Try spraying the top of the uncooked side with some cooking spray or adding butter before flipping to make sure it doesn't stick. If you wish, season with salt and pepper, or even paprika and other spices, as you cook eat side of the egg."
5108,Make Eggs in a Basket,4,A,A5,Serve.,Place your eggs in a basket on a plate. You can eat it with a fork or like a piece of toast.
5109,Make Eggs in a Basket,5,B,B1,Preheat oven to 400°.,"Spray ramekins or a muffin pan with cooking spray, or line them with parchment paper."
5110,Make Eggs in a Basket,6,B,B2,Place bread in ramekins.,"Butter the bread on both sides and fit into the ramekins or muffin pan. Press them gently into the ramekins, allowing the edges to fold over each other.   Since this recipe is baked instead of fried, it is a healthier, calorie friendly variation. To cut calories and make a healthy dish, choose bread with less calories and carbs. To cut even more calories, do not butter the bread. Instead, place it in the ramekins as is. Another variation is to cut holes into a loaf of French bread instead of placing bread into the ramekins.Baking eggs into a French loaf is not a healthier, lower carb, calorie friendly option."
5111,Make Eggs in a Basket,7,B,B3,Bake the eggs.,"Break one egg into each ramekin or muffin tin. Place into the oven and bake for approximately 20 minutes, or until the egg whites are cooked. If you would like harder yolks, cook for longer."
5112,Make Eggs in a Basket,8,B,B4,Remove from oven.,"After letting the ramekin or muffin tin cool, remove the bread bowls and place onto plates. Use a knife to loosen if the bread has stuck to the pan.   Sprinkle seasonings such as salt, pepper, paprika, or garlic on top for flavor. Other options include topping with shredded cheese, bacon or ham, tomatoes, or avocado."
5116,Cook Prime Rib,0,none,1,Select the type of Beef Bone-In Rib Roast you want.,"This may not be called ""Prime Rib"" at your local grocery store or butcher's as ""prime"" is a grade used by the USDA and, in this context, it refers to a kind of cooking. But, rest assured, Beef Bone-In Rib Roast is what you want.   If you are really thinking ahead, you can special order a prime-quality Beef Bone-In Rib Roast. Ask your butcher when he can have you one ready by. Odds are one won't be readily available because the cost incurred is much higher than other grades. You're looking for ribs 6 through 12. If your butcher knows his meat, he'll get you one from the small end toward the back of the rib section. It's generally leaner and gives you more bang for your buck. This is usually called the first cut on the loin, or small, end, because the ribs get larger as they get closer to the shoulder.If you prefer more fat, you may want to go a different route. To help you decide, the small end is where the Ribeye steaks are produced and the large end is used for Delmonico steaks. Does that help?  ;"
5117,Cook Prime Rib,1,none,2,Choose the size of your rib roast.,"Figure about 2 people per rib. So, for six people, you'll need 3 ribs. For fourteen people, you'll need 7. If you have less than six people, you're better off going with individual steaks -- too small a slab of meat won't cook like you want it to.   Always check the date your beef was packaged. If it's been sitting around in the store for a tic, it's not good. It should have a bright red color and absolutely no dry or brown edges. If there's any damage to the wrapping, set it down and choose another option."
5118,Cook Prime Rib,2,none,3,Have your butcher tie the roast.,"You'll need the prime rib tied before roasting, so you might as well get it done right when you buy it. If it's left untied, the outer layer will overcook, pulling away from the muscle. This is totally protocol for it to be done for you, so don't be shy. However, if you forget to ask or if for some odd reason he cannot or does not, here's how:   Trim your roast of any excess fat -- but leave on a thin layer to protect it while it cooks. If it's more than 1"" (2.5 cm) thick, it's gotta go. But leave that much on to give your meal more flavor. Run the twine parallel to the bone and tie at both ends. This literally ties the meat to the bones, keeping it together. Tie around the meat in between the bones and don't forget about the chine bones on the end."
5119,Cook Prime Rib,3,none,4,Leave the roast out until it hits room temperature.,"This should take about 2-4 hours and is absolutely essential. If you don't let the roast come to room temperature, you'll regret it: It will take longer to cook your roast, your roast won't cook evenly, and you'll end up with well-done slices on the end and raw meat in the center.   The amount of time it takes greatly depends on the size of your cut. Use your best judgment on room temperature times."
5120,Cook Prime Rib,4,none,5,Set the oven to 450°F (232°C).,This is to sear the roast initially -- you will bring the temperature down after this blast of heat. Put the oven rack on a lower tier.
5121,Cook Prime Rib,5,none,6,"In a stainless-steel or metal roasting pan, place your roast.","Either ribs side down or fat side up is okay. When choosing a pan, make sure the sides are at least 3"" (7.5 cm) deep.   Nonstick pans are a waste of energy. You'll get fewer tasty bits that give your au jus or gravy flavor. And the rib bones serve as a natural rack, so you won't need a metal one."
5122,Cook Prime Rib,6,none,7,Prep the meat to your liking.,"Some people believe wholeheartedly that you should coat your roast in salt and pepper. Others swear that the salt just dries out the meat -- so avoid it all costs. This is, ultimately, up to you.   You may also find that smearing the cut ends of the roast with a couple tablespoons (30 g) of butter seals in the moisture and makes the ends more tender. Again, proceed at your own discretion."
5123,Cook Prime Rib,7,none,8,Sear the prime rib at this temperature for 15 minutes.,"Then turn the oven to 325°F (162°C) for the rest of the cooking time. Every 1/2 hour, baste the cut ends of the roast with the fat accumulated in the roasting pan. Do not cover the roast."
5124,Cook Prime Rib,8,none,9,Let roast for the allotted time.,"To figure out the total cooking time needed for your roast, allow about 13-15 minutes per pound for rare and 15-17 minutes per pound for medium rare.Grab your meat thermometer (an instant-read digital one makes it easy) and check the internal temperature about 45 minute before you think the prime rib will finish. If anything, start checking early; if something's going wrong, you'll be able to catch it. Meat thermometers will only give you an accurate reading if you're inserting it into the thickest part of the beef. It should not be touching fat or bone. Cook until the temperature is 120° F (49°C) (or your desired temperature).Rare starts at 120°F (49°C) regardless of size. Medium rare is between 125° and 130°F (51° to 54° C). To make sure you're getting the doneness you desire, use a good digital meat thermometer."
5125,Cook Prime Rib,9,none,10,Place roast on a platter and let it sit in a warm spot so the juices can collect.,"Cover loosely with aluminum foil, and let sit approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Cutting into the meat too early will cause a significant loss of juice. Do not skip the resting stage.    Do not cover the roast tightly; that will make the crust soggy. Transfer fat and dark drippings from the pan into a fat separator. Set aside."
5126,Cook Prime Rib,10,none,11,"Grab a long, thin, sharp knife.","Sharpen your carving knife, if necessary, using either a sharpening rod or stone.   To use a sharpening rod, pull the edge of the knife down and across the rod, holding it at a 22° angle (you know what that looks like, right?). Repeat this process 5 to 10 times. If you're using a sharpening stone, hold your knife at a 10° to 15° angle to the stone. Push back and forth in smooth, steady strokes."
5127,Cook Prime Rib,11,none,12,Place the roast on a large meat cutting board.,"If you have one with a well at one end to contain the juices, good for you. First things first, remove the cooking twine with a knife or scissors and dispose."
5128,Cook Prime Rib,12,none,13,Start carving.,"To make it easy on yourself, use a carving fork to hold the roast in place. Turn the platter to where the rib bones are on your left if you are right-handed, or on your right if you use your left hand to carve.   Using your ultra-sharp carving knife, make one cut, slicing off the chine bones (the bones on the large end) to sever the meat from the bones in one piece.  Save the bones for nibbling on later. Or, if you're crafty in the kitchen, make a scrumptious soup!"
5129,Cook Prime Rib,13,none,14,Set roast cut-side down.,"Slice the meat across the grain to the thickness you prefer. 1/4 - 1/2"" (.6-1.25 cm) is fairly standard. Serve, enjoy, loosen your belt a notch, and moan away in prime rib ecstasy."
5130,Parboil Broccoli,0,none,1,Prepare the broccoli florets.,"Wash, cut, and dry before adding.;"
5131,Parboil Broccoli,1,none,2,Prepare a pot with water.,Bring it to the boil and add a little salt to it.
5133,Parboil Broccoli,3,none,4,Place the broccoli into the boiling water.,Only cook it for 2 minutes or for however long your directions say.

5154,Make Mangonadas,1,none,2,Add ingredients to a food processor or blender.,You will add the following: 1/2 cup spreadable apricot fruit Juice of 1 lime 2 1/4 teaspoons ground ancho chili pepper 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar Rehydrated apricots.
5155,Make Mangonadas,2,none,3,Blend the ingredients in the food processor or blender.,"Use a high setting.Make sure the ingredients are evenly mixed. The ingredients may stick to the side of the food processor. In this case, use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl. If you don't have a food processor or traditional blender, you can try using a hand blender."
5156,Make Mangonadas,3,none,4,Store the chamoy in an airtight jar or container.,"You will need to refrigerate the chamoy if you aren't using it right away. For the mangonadas, you will only need 2-3 tablespoons of the chamoy. Measure this out and store the rest. This should keep well in the refrigerator. You can use the rest as a dipping sauce or in a salsa."
5157,Make Mangonadas,4,none,5,Add 2 cups of frozen mango chunks to a blender.,"Pour 1 cup of freshly squeezed orange juice on top.Seal the lid of the blender tightly. Pulse the blender to mix the ingredients. Blend until the mixture is smooth, like a slushie."
5158,Make Mangonadas,5,none,6,Get several small jars.,You will use these to serve the mangonadas. Divide 2-3 tablespoons of chamoy between the jars. Spoon the chamoy into each jar.Spread it around the side and inside of the glass using a knife or back of a spoon. This will allow this spicy condiment to be tasted throughout the mangonada. It should be a relatively thin layer.
5159,Make Mangonadas,6,none,7,Fill the mangonada jars.,You will need to add the frozen mango juice and prepare the topping. Pour the mango and orange juice mixture into each glass. It should still be the consistency of a slushie. Spoon a small amount of chamoy on top of each glass. Swirl this with a spoon to create a design and to mix the flavors. Top with a sprinkling of chili-lime salt. Enjoy on a hot day!
5160,Make Mangonadas,7,none,8,Add 2 pounds of fresh chopped mango to a food processor or blender.,"Pour in 1 cup of sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Seal the lid on the blender or food processor tightly. Process until completely smooth. Use the pulse setting on high."
5161,Make Mangonadas,8,none,9,Pour the mixture into a container.,Put this into the freezer.You will need to freeze the mango mixture until it is completely frozen. This will take approximately 5 hours. Be patient. Making mangonadas from fresh fruit takes much longer than using frozen fruit because of this step.
5162,Make Mangonadas,9,none,10,Scoop out the frozen mango mixture.,Add it to a blender or food processor. This might be difficult if the mixture is very hard. Try using an ice cream scoop or sturdy spoon to scoop out the mixture. Blend the frozen mangonada mixture until it is smooth like a slushie.
5163,Make Mangonadas,10,none,11,Find several small jars and fill them with the frozen mixture and chamoy.,"Top each jar with lime juice and ground chili. Spoon a little bit of chamoy into each jar. Spread it around the inside of the jar with knife or back of a spoon. Add a layer of frozen mango mixture, then top this with a small amount of chamoy. Repeat this layering until the jar is full. Pour a small amount of lime juice on top of each jar and sprinkle some ground chili as a topping."
5164,Make Mangonadas,11,none,12,Consider serving this recipe as individual popsicles.,"To do this, pour the mango mixture (from step 1) in several small cups or popsicle molds.Put a popsicle stick in each. Freeze the individual popsicles until hardened. Cut away the disposable cup or pop the popsicles out of molds. Top each popsicle with some chamoy, squeeze a little lime juice on top, and sprinkle with ground chili."
5165,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,0,none,1,Select your fish.,"In the south, catfish are probably the number one choice, but near clean, sandy bottomed bayous and bays, black mullet are also popular and inexpensive, and easy to prepare.       ;"
5167,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,2,none,3,Prepare your fish.,"After the fish have been cleaned, rinse them with fresh water and while they are wet, drop them in a container of seasoned cornmeal. The type of meal is up to the individual, but medium to fine grind yellow Cornmeal is popular in the south. Salt is the only usual seasoning, but when you get the hang of it, you may want to experiment with other spices. For a finer crust, you can add one part all purpose flour to each 4 parts of Cornmeal. This will allow the fish to cook longer before they brown, for a more well done fish."
5168,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,3,none,4,Shake the fish pieces in the meal until they are thoroughly coated.,"Leave them in the mealing container until they are ready for the fryer. This will help the Cornmeal to adhere better to the fish, giving them a good coating when they fry."
5169,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,4,none,5,"Heat the oil in your cooker to about 330-350 degrees (F), being careful not to allow it to get too hot.","Ease pieces of fish into the hot oil one at a time until it is near its cooking capacity, being careful to avoid splashing the oil."
5170,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,5,none,6,Watch the fish carefully as they cook.,"They will begin to float as they become done, making it easy to observe the color of the pieces. When they are a golden to medium brown, remove them and allow the pieces to drain in a pan or cardboard box lined with paper towels. This is where a basket or strainer comes in handy, since all the fish can be lifted out at one time, the excess oil will drain back into the pot, and the pieces dumped into your holding container."
5171,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,6,none,7,Begin preparing hushpuppies as the fish are frying.,"Because hushpuppies are made with a mixture of cornmeal and wheat flour, adding the liquid to the recipe too early will allow the dry ingredients to absorb too much, making them very heavy and dense."
5172,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,7,none,8,"Chop a whole onion finely, place it into a suitable container, and add eggs and milk.","Mix these ingredients completely. When the last batch of fish are placed into the fryer, add the Cornmeal mix (or separately, 2 parts cornmeal, one part all purpose flour, baking powder, and salt) to the previous ingredients and mix once more."
5173,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,8,none,9,"Remove the last of your fish, and begin dropping the hushpuppies into the hot oil.","Use a spoon to dip batter from your bowl (or other container), then, holding it just above the oil, let it slide off of your spoon. Drop as many hushpuppies as the oil can easily cook. When the hushpuppies are done (cooked) on the bottom, they should float up and the heavier, raw batter on top will cause them to flip themselves over to continue cooking on the other side. Shaking the frying basket will help them do this."
5175,Cook for a Southern Fish Fry,10,none,11,"Serve your fish and hushpuppies with baked beans, cole slaw, potato salad, cheese grits, or other choices of side dishes and a tall glass of iced tea.",
5176,Grill Vegetables,0,none,1,Get the grill hot.,"If you have a gas grill, preheat on medium for at least 10 minutes. If you are using a charcoal grill, wait until the charcoal is good and gray.       ;"
5177,Grill Vegetables,1,none,2,Clean the grill.,"Once it is hot, this will be easy to do. Grab your grill brush and get each nook and cranny of the grate. Then, dab a paper towel in oil and wipe it down to prevent sticking. You'll be glad you did this later when half of your vegetables don't end seared to the grate.          Even though your vegetables have oil on them (they will, right?) you need this coating on your grill. Don't skip this step."
5178,Grill Vegetables,2,none,3,Boil certain vegetables.,"Dense root vegetables like potatoes, carrots, and beets take this extra step. They need to be precooked to let the grilling take effect. Boil them until they're partially cooked (only just starting to get tender) and proceed as normal.          You don't have to boil them whole! Even if they are in smaller pieces, they need the extra cooking time."
5179,Grill Vegetables,3,none,4,Wash the veggies and pat them dry.,"Though raw vegetables are delicious and great for you, they still need to be clean! Run them under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel."
5180,Grill Vegetables,4,none,5,Slice up certain kinds.,"Asparagus, big Portobello mushrooms and corn on the cob don't need to be cut up, but onions, zucchini, and pepper are grilled best when sliced.          The root vegetables discussed above should be sliced up, too."
5181,Grill Vegetables,5,none,6,Oil them up.,"This way, they will not stick to the grill, you will get those restaurant-like grill marks, and they will be delicious. You don't want the oil soaking the vegetables and dripping off in a stream, but you do want them coated evenly.          If a marinade is more your style, see below."
5182,Grill Vegetables,6,none,7,"Alternately, use a marinade of lemon juice and olive oil.","Combine equal parts olive oil and lemon juice. Add fresh herbs like thyme, basil, chives, or rosemary. If you are a garlic fan, a couple cloves will add a good kick. Pour the marinade over the vegetables. Toss the vegetables to coat them and allow them to soak up the flavor for about an hour.          Place these on the grill in a basket or tin foil packet. They are probably sliced into smaller pieces if they are marinated, so keep them above the flames. Depending on the vegetables you used, this could take just a few minutes. Make a taste test if you are unsure -- your tongue will know when they are done."
5183,Grill Vegetables,7,none,8,Consider the size of each vegetable when placing on the grill.,"You will need different apparatuses for the varying sizes. Large pieces can be placed directly on, but if they're too small they'll fall through the grate!          Buy a grilling basket for sliced up onion, pepper, mushrooms, etc. If you do not have time, use tin foil and wrap up in a covered, rectangular shape that opens on top. Another alternative is to use skewers, though those sometimes can be precarious.  If using a foil packet, throw in some butter, oil, and seasonings. If using skewers, use metal ones. Wood and bamboo should be soaked in water for half an hour earlier to prevent charring."
5184,Grill Vegetables,8,none,9,Start grilling!,"You will want to keep an eye on the vegetables as certain ones take longer than others do. Namely eggplant and onion, even if they're cut up.          Asparagus, mushrooms, peppers and zucchini all cook fast. Cooking times vary by size, weight, density, and just how done you like your greens."
5185,Grill Vegetables,9,none,10,Monitor for doneness.,"Once the vegetables are all on, keep an eye on them. Your peppers may finish twice as fast as your eggplant, so stay on the watch. If they're going too fast, move them to the edges of the grill where it's not as hot.          Take off the vegetables as they finish and either put them above the grill (if applicable) or keep them warm on a separate rack or board."

5188,Make Tater Tot Hotdish,1,none,2,"Choose your vegetable: beans, carrots, peas, corn, etc.","One is enough, though a mix can be exciting, too. Mushrooms are good accompaniments to vegetables. Make sure the vegetables are well-thawed."
5189,Make Tater Tot Hotdish,2,none,3,Choose your sauce: cream of mushroom and cream of celery are two old favorites.,"A can of cream of celery or mushroom soup works well and you can add it directly to the browned beef and vegetables. If the sauce is being made from a powder, follow the given directions and allow the sauce to become very thick."

5195,Make Pozole,1,none,2,Toast the chiles.,"The chiles should be seeded and toasted in a large skillet over medium-low heat until fragrant.   The chiles should be about 5 to 6 inches (13 to 15 cm) each. Wipe them clean with a moist paper towel before proceeding. Use a sharp kitchen knife or a pair of kitchen scissors to cut the chiles open lengthwise, from end to end. Dig out the seeds and any large ribs. Heat a heavy skillet or griddle over medium-low heat without oil. Place the chiles on the skillet cut-side-down. Press them down and flip them over with a heat-resistant spatula until they become just barely darkened and fragrant. This should take about 1 minute per chile, and you should work in batches of 1 or 2 chiles at a time."
5196,Make Pozole,2,none,3,Soak the chiles.,Cover the toasted chiles with cold water and let them soak for about 30 minutes.   Use a medium-size bowl. The chiles should soak until they are softened.
5197,Make Pozole,3,none,4,Toast the garlic and onion.,Add the garlic and onion to the heated skillet or griddle in batches. Toast each one until they are golden-brown with a few blackened spots.   You need about 1/4 cup (60 ml) of peeled garlic. You can add up to twice as much if you prefer a stronger garlic taste. Turn the garlic as necessary to prevent it from blackening too much. The garlic will need to be cooked for about 8 minutes. Only flip the onion slices once. The onion needs to be cooked for roughly 15 minutes.
5198,Make Pozole,4,none,5,Puree the sauce ingredients.,"Blend together the drained chiles, tomatoes, garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice with a little water.   After the chiles have finished soaking, drain them and place them into your blender. Add the tomatoes to the blender along with any tomato juice they are sitting in. Add the garlic, onion, cloves, and allspice, as well. Puree the sauce. Add up to 1/2 cup (125 ml) water, pouring in a little at a time, until the sauce becomes very smooth. This should take around 2 minutes."
5199,Make Pozole,5,none,6,Heat the puree.,"Heat the oil in a large stockpot before adding the puree. Fry the puree until it becomes thicker.   Heat the vegetable oil in a 6-qt (6-l) heavy-duty stockpot over medium heat. A Dutch oven also works well. Add the puree. It will likely splatter, so prepare yourself. Reduce the heat to low. Fry the puree, stirring constantly with a wooden spatula or spoon, until it thickens. This should take about 5 minutes."
5200,Make Pozole,6,none,7,Stir in the remaining ingredients and finish cooking.,"Add 1 cup (250 ml) water, as well as the vinegar, sugar, and salt.   After adding the water, raise the heat to medium-high and bring the sauce to a boil. Add the vinegar, sugar, and salt. You will need about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt, but you can add more or less depending on your own sense of taste. Reduce the heat again to medium or medium-low, so that the sauce sits at a steady simmer. Partially cover the pot, leaving a small gap to vent some of the steam. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Add water, if necessary, to keep the sauce at the same consistency."
5201,Make Pozole,7,none,8,Toast and soak the chiles.,"Seed the poblano chiles and toast them in a skillet over medium-high heat until softened. Soak them in hot water for 20 minutes.Use a sharp knife or kitchen shears to cut the chiles open lengthwise. Scrape out any seeds and large veins from the chiles, and remove any stems. Heat a skillet or griddle on medium-high heat without oil. Add the chiles, cut-side-down, and roast them for 1 or 2 minutes until they soften. Flip them once during the cooking process and do not let them burn Add 3 cups (750 ml) of water to a medium saucepan and boil it over medium-high heat. Submerge the toasted chiles in the pot of hot water. Cover the pot and remove it from the heat. Let the chiles soften in the hot water for 15 to 20 minutes."
5202,Make Pozole,8,none,9,Sauté the pork.,"Add the cubed pork to a skillet of hot oil and cook until browned on all sides.   Cover the bottom of a large skillet or Sauté pan with 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) olive oil. Heat the oil on medium-high heat. Dry the pork chunks with clean paper towels and season with salt. Brown the pork for several minutes, stirring infrequently. Make sure that the pork is brown on all sides and that the pan does not become too crowded. If necessary, work in batches. For a richer taste, you can use multiple types of pork instead of just pork shoulder. Substitute 1/3 of the pork for pork spare ribs or baby back ribs, for instance, or half of the pork shoulder for pork loin.Chicken is another popular choice for pozole. You could use a combination of 6 skinless chicken drumsticks and 6 skinless chicken thighs instead of the pork in this recipe. While not as common as pork or chicken, beef can also be used in pozole. Instead of pork shoulder, add 2 to 2 1/2 lb (900 to 1125 g) beef shank, cubed, to the recipe."
5203,Make Pozole,9,none,10,Transfer the pork to the chile sauce.,"Add the browned pork to stockpot of hot chile sauce. Stir it into the sauce and increase the heat to medium-high so that it remains at a steady simmer.   When adding the pork to the sauce, also scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet and add those to the sauce, as well."
5204,Make Pozole,10,none,11,"Add the chicken broth, cilantro, salt, and hominy.","Stir these four ingredients into the chile sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.   When adding the oregano, crumple it with your hands so that it breaks into more pieces as it goes in. Mexican oregano works best, but if you cannot find it, you can also use standard oregano. Add about 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt. You can add more or less to taste, however. Rinse the hominy before adding it, especially if it came from a can. You can add more hominy if desired."
5205,Make Pozole,11,none,12,Cook for 2 to 3 hours.,"Reduce heat and partially cover the stockpot. Cook until the pork is completely tender.   The pozole can be cooked for as little as 1 1/2 hours, but cooking it longer will result in a more tender dish. Leave the stockpot partially uncovered so that steam can escape. Reduce the heat enough so that the pozole just barely simmers."
5206,Make Pozole,12,none,13,Skim the fat.,"Use a ladle to skim excess fat from the top of the pozole once you finish cooking it.   The amount of excess fat will depend on how fatty the meat you used was. More fat adds more flavor, but it also means that you will have more to skim off at the end."
5207,Make Pozole,13,none,14,"Add more salt, if desired.","Taste the broth. If it is too bland, you can add more salt, to taste, at the end.   Make sure that you stir the salt in thoroughly after adding it. You will likely need to add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) or more, depending on your sense of taste."
5208,Make Pozole,14,none,15,"Add more water, as needed.","Since pozole cooks for so long, the sauce may reduce too much and become thick. If this happens, you will need to add more water at the end.   Pozole should be very liquid. Add enough water to form a good broth consistency and heat another 10 to 15 minutes, or until thoroughly incorporated."
5209,Make Pozole,15,none,16,Arrange the garnishes in bowls.The garnishes are served alongside the pozole so that everyone can add what they want.,"Make sure that the lettuce, onion, and radishes are all shredded, chopped, or sliced thinly, making it easy to add them in small amounts. Cabbage can also be used instead of lettuce. Tostadas are crispy, fried corn tortilla shells. You can usually find them pre=packaged, or you can make your own by frying stale corn tortillas in a little hot vegetable oil. Alternatively, you can also use tortilla chips."
5210,Make Pozole,16,none,17,Dish out the hot pozole.,Ladle the hot pozole into individual serving bowls.   Arrange the garnishes in the center of the table so that your family or guests can add garnishes as they please.
5211,Make Middle Eastern Lamb Stew,0,A,A1,Trim the lamb and grate the onion.,Get out 2 pounds (907 g) of lamb shoulder and carefully cut away any excess flaps of fat. Use a sharp knife to cut the lamb into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and set the lamb aside. You'll also need to get out one small onion and peel it. Grate the onion using a cheese grater. Set the grated onion aside.  You should end up with about 1/3 cup (50 g) of grated onion.;

5218,Make Middle Eastern Lamb Stew,7,B,B4,Simmer the spiced stew.,Add the spice mixture to the browned lamb and stir it well so the spices coat the lamb. Pour in 4 cups (950 ml) of water and bring the water to a boil. Turn the heat down to medium-low so that the liquid bubbles gently.

You can serve the stew with flat bread or basmati rice.
5220,Make New England Clam Chowder,0,none,1,Wash the clams.,"Rinse the fresh clams with cold running water to wash away any sand or grit. You may have to rub the shells with your fingers to get them completely clean.   Look over the clams before you cook them. If any of the shells are open while they are still raw, discard those; this means they are not fresh. Some types of clams may take a little longer to cook. Gauge whether they are ready by checking their shells.;"

5293,Make Rye Bread,8,A,A9,Sprinkle the dough with flour and slash the loaf.,"Once the dough has finished proving, take the plastic wrap off. Sprinkle the top of the loaf with more rye flour. Use a sharp, serrated knife to make a few shallow slashes across the top of the loaf.Slashing the bread will give the air a place to escape as it bakes. If you don't slash the bread, the bread may tear unpredictably as it bakes."
5294,Make Rye Bread,9,A,A10,Bake the light rye bread.,"Put the loaf of bread in the preheated oven. Bake the light rye bread for 30 minutes. The top should turn a dark brown.

5302,Make Rye Bread,17,B,B8,Set the dough on a sheet and slash the top.,Lay a sheet of parchment paper or a silicone mat on a baking sheet. Carefully turn the risen dough out of the bowl and onto the baking sheet. Use a sharp knife to make three deep slashes on top of the dough.You can do straight slashes or crosshatches. The slashes help steam escape from the dough as it bakes.
5303,Make Rye Bread,18,B,B9,Bake the dark rye bread.,"Put the bread in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Since you won't be able to tell whether the bread is finished baking based on the color, you'll need to take it out of the oven. Turn the bread over and tap the bottom.

5369,Cook Rabbit,0,A,A1,Mix the marinade.,"Combine the olive oil, Dijon mustard, and a dash of black pepper in a bowl, whisking the ingredients together thoroughly.  You can mix the marinade in a large resealable plastic bag or inside a dish that is large enough to fit all the rabbit pieces in a single layer.;"
5370,Cook Rabbit,1,A,A2,Marinate the rabbit for at least 1 hour.,"Place the rabbit pieces into the marinade and toss well to coat. Cover and refrigerate for a minimum of 1 hour, if not longer.  When roasting an entire rabbit, only use farmed rabbit. If using wild rabbit, only use the saddle or torso of the rabbit. Farmed rabbit has much more fat, so it fares better in dry heat methods like roasting than wild rabbit does. Since the saddle of wild rabbit is fatty enough, though, it can still be roasted. Use 2 large saddles or 4 smaller saddles from wild rabbits in place of 2 full farmed rabbits. Marinating the rabbit for 2 hours is actually ideal since the marinade will have more time to permeate and flavor the meat."
5371,Cook Rabbit,2,A,A3,Preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius.),Prepare an ovenproof frying pan by adding the butter to it and warming it over medium-high heat.  Continue heating the butter until it melts. Duck fat or lard can also be used instead of unsalted butter.
5372,Cook Rabbit,3,A,A4,Brown the rabbit pieces.,"Add the rabbit to the butter in the frying pan and cook it for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, or until browned on each side."
5373,Cook Rabbit,4,A,A5,Cook the rabbit in the oven.,"Transfer the ovenproof frying pan with the rabbit and remaining butter into the preheated oven. Cook for about 6 to 8 minutes before testing the pieces for doneness.  When done, the meat should feel firm and there should no longer be any internal redness or blood. Drain the pan drippings before returning the pan to the stove."
5374,Cook Rabbit,5,A,A6,Add the stock and heat.,"Pour the stock into the frying pan and heat it over medium until the stock begins to simmer.  The simmer should be fairly gentle. Do not let the stock reach a rapid, rolling boil."
5375,Cook Rabbit,6,A,A7,Let rest before serving.,Remove the frying pan from the heat and let it rest in a warm area for 10 minutes. Serve while still warm.
5377,Cook Rabbit,8,B,B2,Dredge the rabbit pieces with flour.,"Sprinkle salt and black pepper over the rabbit pieces before tossing them into the flour. Make sure that all sides of the rabbit are coated well.  You could combine the flour with the salt and pepper beforehand or add the salt and pepper to the rabbit separately. Either method will work. Pour the flour into a large resealable plastic bag or into a shallow dish before dredging the rabbit pieces. If you use a bag, you can toss the pieces into the bag, seal it, and shake thoroughly. If using a shallow dish, turn and coat all sides by hand."
5378,Cook Rabbit,9,B,B3,Arrange the oil and vegetables in the prepared casserole dish.,"Place the onion slices, minced garlic, sliced carrots, and sliced mushrooms in your casserole dish. Drizzle with oil and toss well to coat.  Try to keep the various vegetables as evenly distributed as possible to ensure even cooking."
5379,Cook Rabbit,10,B,B4,Place the rabbit pieces on the vegetables.,Arrange the floured rabbit pieces on top of the vegetable layer. Keep the rabbit in a single layer so that the pieces cook evenly.
5380,Cook Rabbit,11,B,B5,Add the herbs and wine.,"Sprinkle the parsley, thyme, and oregano over the rabbit pieces and vegetables evenly. Stick the bay leaves into the vegetable medley and pour the wine over the contents of the dish evenly.  Make sure that the liquid in the dish reaches the level of the rabbit pieces. In order to actually braise the rabbit, the meat itself needs to sit inside the cooking liquid as it cooks."
5381,Cook Rabbit,12,B,B6,Bake for 1 hour.,Cover the dish and bake it until the rabbit becomes tender.  Use aluminum foil to cover the dish if you end up using a dish without an oven-proof lid.
5382,Cook Rabbit,13,B,B7,Remove bay leaves and serve.,"Fish the bay leaves out of the casserole dish. Serve the rabbit while still warm, serving the vegetable blend alongside it."
5383,Cook Rabbit,14,C,C1,Mix the buttermilk and the spices.,"Whisk the buttermilk together with the Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne pepper in a small dish until well combined.  If you do not have an Italian seasoning blend, you could substitute 1/2 cup mixed and chopped fresh herbs. Use herbs like oregano, thyme, and parsley."
5384,Cook Rabbit,15,C,C2,Marinate the rabbit pieces.,Place the rabbit pieces in the spiced buttermilk and turn to coat all sides. Cover and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight.  A longer marinating time means a stronger flavor and more tender meat.
5385,Cook Rabbit,16,C,C3,Pour the oil in a large heavy-bottomed pan and let it heat up.,"Bring the oil to temperature over medium-high heat. Ideally, the oil should be heated to a temperature around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (160 degrees Celsius).  Check the temperature of the oil using a candy thermometer. Note that you may need to continually check the temperature of the oil during the cooking process to make sure that it does not get too cool or too hot. Do not let the oil smoke at any point during the cooking process. If you do not have a candy thermometer, test the oil by quickly sprinkling flour into it. The flour should sizzle upon contact. A large cast iron frying pan is the ideal type of pan to use. Keep in mind that once you add the rabbit pieces, the oil should reach roughly the halfway point up along the side of the pieces."
5387,Cook Rabbit,18,C,C5,Dredge the rabbit in the flour mixture.,"Mix the flour and salt in a large plastic bag, shaking until well combined. Place a few pieces into the bag and shake well to coat all sides."
5388,Cook Rabbit,19,C,C6,"Fry for 22 to 30 minutes, turning once.","Fry for 12 to 15 minutes at a steady sizzle. Turn using tongs and fry for another 10 to 15 minutes.  The rabbit should fry at a gentle sizzle. It should not be violent, but it should do more than merely sit in the oil. Remove all the pieces separately as they turn crispy and golden brown. The belly flap pieces and forelegs will finish up first. The loin will be next, and the hind legs will be last. If you need to fry the rabbit pieces in batches, let them drain in the colander as they wait. Only flour the rabbit pieces immediately before you intend to fry them."
5389,Cook Rabbit,20,C,C7,Drain and serve.,"Transfer the rabbit pieces to layers of clean paper towels or brown paper bags. Let drain for a few minutes before serving, and serve the pieces hot or at room temperature."
5390,Cook Rabbit,21,D,D1,Place the first nine ingredients in a slow cooker.,"Layer the rabbit pieces, celery, carrots, onion, water chestnuts, and mushroom inside the slow cooker. Pour the chicken broth over the contents of the slow cooker and sprinkle with salt and pepper as desired.  If you are not sure about how much salt and pepper to go with, try 1 tsp (5 ml) of salt and 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of pepper."
5391,Cook Rabbit,22,D,D2,Cook on low for 6 hours.,"Cover the slow cooker and let the rabbit cook until it becomes tender enough to fall apart when cut into with a fork.  The cover must stay on throughout the entire 6 hours. If you remove the cover, you will allow some of the heat that has built up inside to escape. This heat is an essential element involved in cooking the contents of the slow cooker, though, so letting any at all escape can affect the cooking time."
5392,Cook Rabbit,23,D,D3,Combine the sherry and cornstarch.,Vigorously whisk the two ingredients together in a small dish until well combined into a slurry.
5393,Cook Rabbit,24,D,D4,Thicken the sauce.,"Remove the rabbit from the slow cooker and stir the corn starch slurry into the remaining sauce. Cover and cook on high for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the sauce thickens.  Alternatively, you could pour the sauce into a medium saucepan and add the cornstarch slurry to it that way. Heat the contents of the saucepan on medium-high until they reach a boil. Let boil for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the sauce thickens. Keep the cooked rabbit pieces warm as you thicken the sauce."
5394,Cook Rabbit,25,D,D5,Mix the rabbit back into the slow cooker.,Add the rabbit back to the sauce in the slow cooker and mix gently to coat.  The purpose behind this step is to coat the rabbit in the final sauce while also reheating it through.
5395,Cook Rabbit,26,D,D6,Serve.,Transfer the rabbit pieces to individual serving dishes. Ladle the sauce over the rabbit before serving.
5397,Cook Rabbit,28,E,E2,"Season rabbit, if desired, with salt and pepper.","Melt 3 Tbsp. butter in a 12 inch (30.5 cm) skillet over medium-high heat and cook rabbit, stirring occasionally, until rabbit is thoroughly cooked. Remove rabbit from pan and set aside."
5398,Cook Rabbit,29,E,E3,"Add tomatoes and broccoli into the same skillet, reduce to medium heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until tender.",Add cooked rabbit back to skillet and keep warm.
5401,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,0,none,1,Prepare a broth in a large pot or wok that will be used to cook the hot pot ingredients.,"There is no right or wrong way to prepare a broth, so feel free to get creative and customize your own. Examples of broths include: plain pork bone, pork bone with coconut milk, spicy mala (with varying degrees of spiciness), tomato, curry, and miso. You can also consider purchasing pre-made broth from some Chinese restaurants or pre-packaged ingredients of popular hot pot restaurants in Asian grocery stores.   A simple broth can be made by boiling water with the addition of meat bones or fish heads and a combination of herbs (ginger, goji berries, red dates, bay leaf, cloves, star anise, whole dried red chilies, cinnamon bark, fennel), seasonings (white pepper, sichuan peppercorn), and vegetables (scallions, garlic, napa cabbage, mushrooms). You will want to boil the ingredients until the water has been reduced and becomes infused with the flavor of the ingredients; then, strain the broth. Traditional combinations include:  1) Plain: Chicken and/or pork bone, ginger, goji berries, red dates, white pepper, scallions, and optional napa cabbage and/or mushrooms; 2) Spicy Mala: Beef bone, ginger, garlic, chili oil, whole dried red chilies, bay leaf, star anise, cinnamon stick, cloves, and fried tofu puffs. In both recipes you can substitute the meat broth with vegetable broth for vegetarians or vegans.  ;"
5402,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,1,none,2,Slice a variety of meats and fish thinly to be cooked in the hot pot.,"Slicing thinly will ensure that the ingredients will cook quickly and fully.   Choose any proteins (meat, variety of fish, or tofu) that you enjoy. Some common choices for Chinese hot pot include thinly sliced beef, pork, lamb (which you can marinate in red wine), chicken, thin fish fillets, squid, shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams, fish cake, fish balls (sometimes stuffed with meat or fish eggs), shrimp balls, cuttlefish balls, shrimp or fish paste, beef balls, plain tofu, fried tofu, ice tofu, tofu sheets, tofu puffs, and quail eggs. You can make your hot pot using the more traditional method of using the meats and seafood that are local to you."
5403,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,2,none,3,Select and prepare some vegetables.,"Wash and prepare some leafy greens. Popular options include: watercress, bok choy, tong ho, spinach, napa cabbage, cabbage, lettuce, snow pea leaves, daikon, taro, lotus root, winter melon, kabocha squash, tomato, and quarter cobs of corn. Mushrooms of all varieties are also common to Chinese hot pot preparations: king oyster mushroom, shiitake, enoki, and shimeji."
5404,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,3,none,4,"Have enough noodles for all of your guests alongside the hot pot to eat with their selections as a side dish, or simply use the broth to cook the noodles at the end of the meal.","The noodles will be infused with the flavors of all of the ingredients that everyone has cooked in it.   You can use any type of noodle, and there are many options: knife-cut, rice noodles, egg noodles, ramen, udon, and glass noodles. Feel free to offer a variety, but note that several people will be full before you even get to the noodles at the end or want to skip them altogether. You can also provide rice to complement the meal, though not everyone may want it."
5405,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,4,none,5,Add other ingredients if desired.,"For more variety, consider incorporating dumplings, rice cakes, and tangyuan (sweet dumplings - with various fillings such as taro, sweet or salty egg, red bean, or no filling)."
5406,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,5,none,6,Place a variety of condiments on the table where you are dining and encourage your guests to create their own sauce to dip their ingredients.,"Typical condiments to prepare a sauce include satay sauce, chive flower sauce, sesame paste, hot mustard, soy sauce, black vinegar, hoisin sauce, sesame oil, chili oil, and sweet chili sauce. You can also include chopped garlic, scallions, and raw egg. Give each guest a separate small dish to mix their sauce.   A common sacha sauce recipe includes: Chinese BBQ sauce, soy sauce, black vinegar, chopped garlic, chopped scallions, and a raw egg on top. Some people will even separate the yolk from the egg white, adding only the yolk to the sauce and simply spreading the extra egg white across some raw meat to be cooked together."
5407,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,6,none,7,"Transfer your broth, omitting any solids, into a wok, clay pot or any pot that is wide and shallow so that everyone will be able to easily dip their ingredients into it.",Place an electric heating plate on the table where you will be eating and place the broth on top of it to keep it hot.   You can also use a gas cooktop as an additional option.
5408,Make a Chinese Hot Pot,7,none,8,Try to arrange the seating so that everyone is sitting in a circle and has easy access to everything on the table.,"Eating a Chinese hot pot is a very communal experience. People gather around the pot, dipping their food, waiting for it to cook, mixing their own sauces and enjoying each other's company. Chinese hot pot meals commonly last a couple of hours because you are cooking and eating in small portions at the same time.   Multiple hot pots can also be used, or individual hot pots. At home, a single hot pot would work well up to 4-8 people depending on the size of the pot. Oftentimes there are communal chopsticks, strainers, and ladles to be shared for moving items into your own bowl. As a courtesy to others, be sure to acknowledge and use these utensils."

5410,Cook Oysters,0,A,A1,Prepare the oysters for steaming.,"Scrub the outside of the shells with a scrub brush under cold, running water to remove all dirt. Discard any open or cracked shells, since this is a sign of a dead or compromised oyster.Do not wash your oysters far in advance of eating them. Washing your oysters hours before you plan on steaming them may kill them: Chemicals such as chlorine and poisons such as lead may leave your oysters tasting less fresh than they might otherwise be.;"
5411,Cook Oysters,1,A,A2,Prepare the steaming liquid.,Pour 2 inches (5.06 cm) of water into a pot. Add a half glass of the beer or a glass of wine to the water for a bit of flavor and aroma. Place a metal steamer tray or colander into the pot to hold the oysters. Arrange the oysters on the tray or colander. Bring steaming liquid to a boil and then cover the pot with a lid.
5412,Cook Oysters,2,A,A3,Steam the oysters for approximately 5 minutes.,"Turn the burner to medium-high and allow the oysters to steam for 5 to 10 minutes — 5 minutes for a medium-cooked oyster, 10 for a well-done oyster. At this point, most of the oysters should have opened. Discard any oysters that did not open."
5413,Cook Oysters,3,A,A4,"Alternately, steam oysters on a roasting dish in a grill.","Lay your oysters out evenly on an old roasting dish that's filled with a little bit of water. Set your burner to medium-high heat, cover your grill, and let cook for 5-10 minutes.   Oysters are done when their shells open. Discard any oysters that didn't open during the cooking process."
5414,Cook Oysters,4,B,B1,Prepare the oysters for grilling.,"Scrub the outside of the shells with a scrub brush under cold, running water to remove all dirt. Discard any open or cracked shells. Let the oysters sit under water briefly, and then remove from the water while letting them drain."
5415,Cook Oysters,5,B,B2,Prepare the grill.,"Use a charcoal grill or gas grill. Bring the grill to a medium high heat. Lay the oysters on the grill, flat side on the grill itself."
5417,Cook Oysters,7,B,B4,Prepare a seasoning for oysters on the half shell (optional).,"Oysters are great raw or cooked in their own brine, but sometimes a little seasoning makes the oyster shine even more. Look for ideas that suit your own tastes. For inspiration try out some of the following:   Butter and garlic Butter and soy sauce Butter, shallot, fresh parsley, cheese (Pecorino), cayenne, paprika BBQ sauce"
5418,Cook Oysters,8,B,B5,Cook the oysters.,"Shut the lid to the grill and allow it to remain closed for 5 or 6 minutes. Open the lid and check on the oysters. What you're looking for will differ depending on how you prepared them:   Whole oysters should be checked for opening of the shell. You'll initially notice a line beginning to separate in the shell. Look for bubbling of the oyster brine inside that small separation. Throw out any oysters that haven't opened after 5-10 minutes. Oysters on the half shell need to be vetted before and during the shucking process to ensure they're safe to eat. If the oyster is already open prior to shucking, or it doesn't put up any resistance during shucking and pops right open, throw it out. Oysters on the half shell will tighten slightly when cooked; their liquid will bubble and help cook them over the course of 5-10 minutes."
5419,Cook Oysters,9,B,B6,Remove whole oysters or oysters on the half-shell carefully so that they retain their juices.,"Serve with drawn butter, lemon, or as-is."
5420,Cook Oysters,10,C,C1,Prepare the fryer.,Heat a deep fryer to 375° F (190° C).
5421,Cook Oysters,11,C,C2,Shuck your oysters.,"Cover the front of the oyster with a cloth and carefully slide an oyster knife into the hinge at the back of the oyster. Twist the knife with your wrist to break the hinge. Then slide the knife around the top of the shell, prying the top shell off when loose enough. Slide the knife under the bottom of the oyster flesh to remove the oyster foot from the bottom shell."
5422,Cook Oysters,12,C,C3,Coat the oysters for frying.,"Combine flour, salt and black pepper. Lightly beat together 2 eggs in a separate bowl. Drain 12 ounces of shucked oysters and dredge them in the egg mixture. Coat them in the dry mixture. Coat evenly and thickly but remove excess flour."
5423,Cook Oysters,13,C,C4,Fry the oysters.,"Place the oysters, 5 or 6 at a time, in the deep fryer. Allow them to cook for 2 minutes until they are golden brown."
5424,Cook Oysters,14,C,C5,Serve hot and enjoy!,
5425,Cook Oysters,15,D,D1,Wash your oysters thoroughly.,"Put on gloves so that the rough exterior of the shells don't scrape your hands while you wash any grit and grime from the oysters. Wash the oysters in a place where the runoff won't damage any of your yard and/or equipment.   Again, wash your oysters immediately before you plan on roasting them. Washing oysters too early before cooking can kill them, making them inedible. Oysters from a purveyor are often washed when they are harvested, but it won't hurt to give them a once-over. You're better safe than sorry."
5427,Cook Oysters,17,D,D3,Place your oysters on top of the sheet metal in a single layer.,Make sure you have enough oysters. Budget anywhere from 6 - 16 oysters per person.
5428,Cook Oysters,18,D,D4,Cover oysters with a wet burlap sack or wet beach towel and wait for oysters to fully cook.,"Although burlap sacks work a little better than towels (and won't look unbecoming when they get steamed), towels are perfectly acceptable.   Give the batch of oysters anywhere from 8 to 10 minutes to finish cooking. If you prefer oysters to be less cooked, aim for about 8 minutes. If you prefer your oysters to be more cooked, aim to keep them under the burlap sack for a couple more minutes. Throw away any oysters that haven't opened 1/4"" to 1/2"" after 10 minutes."
5429,Cook Oysters,19,D,D5,"While you wait for the sheet metal to heat up again, enjoy your first batch of oysters with friends.",The sheet should take a handful of minutes to properly heat up. Repeat process over again when sheet metal is hot enough to receive a new batch of oysters.

5460,Make Popovers,0,none,1,Preheat the oven to 450 °F (232 °C).,"Popovers get their shape because the high heat quickly puffs up the steam inside the pastry, so your oven needs to be hot."
5461,Make Popovers,1,none,2,Place a small piece of butter at the bottom of each well in a muffin pan.,"You do not need a popover pan to make them, as a regular muffin dish will work fine. You can also use 6-ounce custard dishes.Non-stick cooking spray can substituted for butter."

5463,Make Popovers,3,none,4,Whisk in the flour until it is completely mixed.,"You do not want to overmix, as this leads to a coarse and chewy popover. Simply whisk it until there are no more chunks of flour, then stop.   You should see little air bubbles – this is what will cause the popover to rise later."
5464,Make Popovers,4,none,5,Place the muffin pan in the oven for 2-3 minutes to warm.,To make popovers “pop” you need to preheat the pan. This heats up the batter and causes it to grow rapidly in the first 20 minutes in the oven.
5465,Make Popovers,5,none,6,Divide the batter into each cup.,"Put an equal amount of batter in each popover pan, muffin dish, or custard cup and put them in the oven.   Some cooks suggest quickly whisking the batter before pouring so that it is frothy and airy as it goes into the pan.Be careful-- the dish will still be hot from the oven."

5468,Make Popovers,8,none,9,Turn the heat down to 375 °F (191 °C) and bake for an additional 10 minutes.,"After the first 20 minutes, the popovers will have a crispy shell and will retain their form. Lower the heat and cook them for an additional 10-20 minutes, or until the outsides are golden brown.   It is safe to open the oven door during this second cooking period. If you have 2 pans of popovers in, rotate them now so that they heat evenly."
5469,Make Popovers,9,none,10,Remove the popovers and turn them out on a wire rack to cool.,"The outside will be crispy and the popover won’t collapse or crumble, so quickly pull them out of the oven and set them aside to cool."
5470,Make Popovers,10,none,11,Use a knife to cut a slit in the bottoms.,This allows the steam to quickly escape the pastry and keep it crispy when you serve it.

5472,Make Popovers,12,none,13,Add melted butter for a richer pastry.,"Melt 2-3 tablespoons of butter and whisk it into the batter with the milk and eggs for a rich, buttery popover.   Let the butter cool slightly after melting it – otherwise it might cook the eggs slightly.;"
5473,Make Popovers,13,none,14,Top your popovers with shredded cheese before cooking.,"Simply sprinkle shredded cheese, such as gruyere or cheddar, on top of the batter before it goes in the oven, then cook normally. The final popover will by topped with crispy, delicious cheese."
5476,Roast Partridge,0,none,1,Combine the brine ingredients.,"Place the salt, bay leaf, dried thyme, and rosemary in a large bowl or dish. Pour steaming hot tap water over the other ingredients in the dish.   Make sure that the dish you use is also large enough to hold both partridges. The water does not need to be boiling hot, but it should be as hot as your tap can make it.;"
5478,Roast Partridge,2,none,3,Submerge the partridge.,"Place both partridges in the brine. Make sure that they are completely covered by the brine.   Once the birds are inside, cover the dish more securely with a lid or a piece of plastic wrap."
5480,Roast Partridge,4,none,5,Dry off the partridge.,"Remove the partridges from the brine and pat them dry with clean paper towels.   You should also let the birds sit out at room temperature for about 20 minutes after pulling them out of the brine. This allows more of the excess moisture to dry, and it also drops the temperature of the meat to a warmer temperature, thereby reducing the amount of time the partridges will spend cooking in dry heat."
5481,Roast Partridge,5,none,6,Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius).,"Prepare a small roasting pan or shallow baking dish by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.   The foil is not strictly necessary, but it can make it easier to clean the dish later."
5482,Roast Partridge,6,none,7,Place the partridge in the roasting pan.,"Arrange both partridges in the same roasting pan, breast-side up.   Ideally, the two partridges should be in a single snug layer. There should not be much excess room for them to move around."
5483,Roast Partridge,7,none,8,Add the butter and broth.,"Rub the softened butter over each partridge. After applying the butter, pour the chicken broth over the partridges, as well.   When applying the butter, make sure that you get all outer sides of the skin. If there is any butter left after the outside is finished, tuck it underneath the skin. Between the salt in the brine, the salt in the broth, and the salt in the bacon (see next step), there should be plenty of salt to thoroughly season the meat of the partridges at this point. Do not add any more."
5484,Roast Partridge,8,none,9,Drape the bacon over the bird.,"Lay or wrap the bacon over the partridges, using two slices of bacon per bird.   If you choose to wrap the bacon over the partridges instead of merely laying it on top, you may need to use toothpicks to hold the bacon in place.Note that sliced salt pork can be used instead of bacon, if desired. The bacon adds flavor to the partridges, but it is also another trick used to help keep the meat moist during the dry cooking process."
5485,Roast Partridge,9,none,10,Cover with foil.,"Cover the entire roasting pan loosely with aluminum foil.   The wrapping should be fairly loose. If you make it too tight, it could disturb the bacon lying on top of the birds."
5486,Roast Partridge,10,none,11,Roast for 25 minutes.,"Place the roasting dish in the oven and let the partridges cook, covered, for roughly 25 minutes.Meanwhile, prepare a second small baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil."
5487,Roast Partridge,11,none,12,Remove the foil and continue roasting.,"Remove the dish from the oven and take off the foil. Take the bacon off of the partridges, then cook both the birds and the bacon separately for another 10 minutes.   Place the bacon on the lined baking sheet before returning it to the oven. The partridges should remain in their original roasting dish, but they should be cooked uncovered during this part of the process. Baste the partridges with the juices in the pan before returning them to the oven. Do so once more after about 5 minutes, or halfway through this final part of the cooking process."
5488,Roast Partridge,12,none,13,Let the partridge rest.,"Pull the partridges and the bacon out of the oven. Let the meat rest while you prepare the sauce.   The bacon will be crisp when done. The partridges should be golden brown when done, with an internal temperature of 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82.2 degrees Celsius). If you do not have a meat thermometer, you can perform a quick visual test for doneness by piercing the partridge with a fork. The fork should glide in easily. You should also be able to wiggle both legs of the partridge without difficulty. Place the partridges and bacon on a warm serving plate during this time and cover them with more foil. No matter how long it takes for you to prepare the gravy, the partridges should rest for at least 5 to 10 minutes."
5492,Roast Partridge,16,none,17,"Season with mustard, jelly, salt, and pepper.","Add these four remaining ingredients to the gravy. Stir them in thoroughly, then heat through.   If desired, you could skip the Dijon mustard and red currant jelly, adding only the salt and pepper. Doing so will create a more traditional poultry-style gravy."
5493,Roast Partridge,17,none,18,Serve with bacon and gravy.,"Place one partridge on one serving plate. Lay two pieces of bacon on top, then spoon some of the gravy over the entire thing.   You could also serve the bacon on the side, if desired. If you want each person to be able to add the gravy separately, ladle it into a gravy boat and set it down on the side of the plates."

5660,Make Tinga De Pollo,4,none,5,Let the chicken cool.,"Remove the chicken from the saucepan and set it aside on a clean platter or bowl. Allow it to cool to room temperature.   Do not dump the cooking liquid yet. You will use some of it later on in the recipe. You may, however, wish to strain the onion and garlic from the liquid by pouring the contents of the saucepan through a colander. You only need the liquid broth, not the solid ingredients."
5661,Make Tinga De Pollo,5,none,6,Shred the chicken.,"Use your fingers or two forks to shred the chicken into rough pieces.   Keep the shredded chicken on the platter and set it aside for the time being. You will not use it immediately, but you will need it again shortly."
5662,Make Tinga De Pollo,6,none,7,Combine the tomatoes and broth.,Place the chopped tomatoes and 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the reserved chicken broth in medium saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium heat.
5663,Make Tinga De Pollo,7,none,8,Simmer for 10 minutes.,"Once the mixture starts to simmer, start the clock. Let the tomatoes simmer in the broth until they are soft and cooked through.   The tomatoes should be mushy at this point, but they should not be soft enough to completely fall apart."
5664,Make Tinga De Pollo,8,none,9,Blend the tomatoes until smooth.,"Use a slotted spoon to remove the tomatoes and transfer them to a blender. Blend them on a medium speed until they turn into a smooth sauce.   You could use a food processor instead of a blender, if desired. If the sauce is too thick for your liking, you can add another 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (60 to 125 ml) of the reserved chicken broth or water to help thin it out. Blend thoroughly after making the addition."
5665,Make Tinga De Pollo,9,none,10,Heat the oil in a skillet.,"Pour the vegetable oil in a large, deep skillet and set the skillet on the stove over medium heat.   Give the oil a minute or so to warm up. It should be hot and notably thin, but it should not be allowed to start smoking."
5666,Make Tinga De Pollo,10,none,11,Add the remaining onion.,"Dump the remaining chopped onion into the hot oil. Stir fry for 3 to 5 minutes, or until it becomes soft and translucent.   Stir the onion frequently as it cooks to prevent it from burning."
5667,Make Tinga De Pollo,11,none,12,Add the remaining garlic.,"Add the second minced garlic clove to the skillet with the onion. Stir fry the mixture for an additional 1 minute.   Both the onion and garlic should lightly brown during this time. The entire mixture should become notably fragrant, as well. As before, you need to stir the onion and garlic frequently to prevent them from burning. Garlic can burn quickly, so you need to pay close attention."
5668,Make Tinga De Pollo,12,none,13,Pour in the tomato sauce.,"Pour the pureed tomato sauce into the skillet with the onion and garlic. Stir well, distributing the onion and garlic throughout.   Allow the sauce to heat up to a slight simmer, then proceed with the next step."
5669,Make Tinga De Pollo,13,none,14,Add the remaining seasoning ingredients to the sauce.,"Stir the chipotle peppers in adobe sauce, oregano, salt, and pepper into the sauce currently simmering in the skillet.   The chipotle chiles and adobo sauce are what give this dish heat. If you want to produce a milder flavor, only add a portion of the can instead of adding the entire thing."
5670,Make Tinga De Pollo,14,none,15,Simmer 10 minutes.,"Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce continue to simmer for another 10 minutes to thoroughly combine the flavors.   The color of the sauce should also change into a deep red color during this time. Consider keeping the lid partially on the skillet during this time. The steam should be allowed to vent, but keeping the lid tilted on top of the pan can help prevent the sauce from splattering out as it simmers."
5671,Make Tinga De Pollo,15,none,16,Mix in the shredded chicken.,"Add the shredded chicken to the sauce, mixing it in so that all of the chicken is evenly coated. Heat through.The chicken should absorb most of the liquid in the sauce during this time. The final mixture should be moist, but not watery. This step completes the actual tinga de pollo, but you still need to prepare the tostadas if you want to serve this dish in the traditional way."
5672,Make Tinga De Pollo,16,none,17,Heat oil in a skillet.,"Pour enough vegetable oil into a large skillet to fill 1/4 inch (6 mm) of the bottom. Heat the oil on the stove over medium-high heat.   Let the oil heat up for 1 or 2 minutes. It should be very hot, but not quite smoking. Note that you can save time by simply using packaged tostada shells instead of using corn tortillas. If using tostada shells, skip the frying and draining steps and move directly onto the assembling steps."
5673,Make Tinga De Pollo,17,none,18,Drop in the tortillas.,Add one corn tortilla to the hot oil and fry it for 20 to 40 seconds on each side.Use tongs to turn the tortilla halfway through the frying process. The entire tortilla should be crisp and golden in color when ready.
5675,Make Tinga De Pollo,19,none,20,Spread the crema Mexicana over the shell.,"Place one tostada onto your serving plate and add a dollop of crema Mexicana or sour cream. Spread the cream evenly over the surface of the shell.   If you do not like the taste of sour cream, you can skip this step. Another option is to spread a dollop of refried beans over the surface of the shell instead of or alongside the cream."
5676,Make Tinga De Pollo,20,none,21,Add a helping of tinga de pollo.,"Spoon on a generous helping of the prepared tinga de pollo.   You can leave the chicken piled in a mound in the center of the tortilla, or you could spread it evenly over the surface of the tortilla."
5677,Make Tinga De Pollo,21,none,22,Top with your desired garnishes.,"Arrange a few avocado slices on top of the chicken. Sprinkle the entire thing with shredded lettuce, crumbled Cotija cheese, and a spoonful of salsa.   You can skip these ingredients or substitute them for other garnishes as desired. These toppings are common and recommended, but not strictly necessary."
5678,Make Tinga De Pollo,22,none,23,Enjoy immediately.,The tinga de pollo is now prepared and the tostadas are now assembled. Eat the dish while it is still hot.
